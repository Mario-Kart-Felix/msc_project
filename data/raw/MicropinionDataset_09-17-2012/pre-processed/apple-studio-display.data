the picture is very crips and sharp in its native resolution which is a perfect one , and its easy on the eyes in two ways  .
its not only beautiful , but my eyes never get sore after hours in front of it .
the crisp detail at 1280 x 1024 is astounding  .
i transitioned from a 19 flat    crt and i feel like i gained screen real estate  .
i recommend this screen highly  .
oh , and by the way , this screen does work with windows  .
you just need the dvi    ator by dr  .
bott www  .
drbott  .
com or the apple adc to dvi adapter  .
both cost the same amount i think .
i cannot remember the last time a mere product gave me so much pleasure  .
i find the design beautiful  .
the image is slightly fuzzy at non    native resolutions , but at 1280 x 1024 the image quality is devastating   colours are bright and vivid , text is sharp , video is smooth  .
the amount of screen real estate is impressively larger than on my 17 crt  .
it's also easy on the eyes   i can stare at the screen all day without eye    strain  .
the only problem is that now i do not want to leave the office  .
if your computer supports the adc connection , buy this screen .
just replaced a sony 18  .
1 with the 17 apple studio display what a difference  .
bright , uniform lighting from side to side (unlike the sony) and far better color rendition .
once again , apple's products are better quality than others  .
i own a planar 15 flat panel and a viewsonic 17 this one is clearer , sharper , brighter and better in every way  .
thanks , apple .
have both this and the 22 display as well as other pc flat panel displays in the office  .
the operative word really is stunning when you use this monitor .
it has the clearest picture i've ever seen , especially under os x  .
it also has two usb ports on the back , and really cool finger    sensing buttons , one to wake up and put the computer to sleep , and the other to open the display control panel/display panel in os x sys  .
absolutely the best 17 flat panel on the market  .
stunning in every way  .
if i talk about it too much , i'll sound like i work for apple  .
you should definitely buy this if you have the adc connector on your machine (the 22 is absolutely gorgeous as well)  .
on one can refuse that apple did a good job on this nice design apple studio display  .
although the price is a bit higher , but it is not disappointed me  .
it's work very well will graphic images , texts and new os x  .
the color is so bright  .
if you are mac user , i recommended you to buy it .
i bought the 17 studio display with my new dual 800mhz g4 and am stunned  .
i have been a strict windows user until now and i never think i will go back  .
this screen accompanied by os 10  .
1 make for the perfect computer  .
the screen gives my desk space i never had and picuter i never had  .
i am very pleased  .
i just took delivery of my dp 800 g4 yesterday , and i finally got to hook up the 17 studio display and see it for myself  .
this thing is amazing  .
crystal clarity , great viewing angles , and what a snap (literally) to hook up  .
possibly one of the best attributes is that ther is almost no wire clutter only one cable reaching down to the tower so very clean  .
all this , and i got a great buy on it as an open box  .
highly reccomended good job (again) apple  .
outpost  .
com for $995  .
it seems like the days are turning into weeks as i wait and wait for its delivery  .
it is a little pricey , but its utility will make up for it , i am certain  .
i have to admitt , i purchased it mostly to compliment my new quicksilver (why have such a stunning tower paired with an ugly biege box for a monitor  .
i is concerned about color management intially , but after reading as much as i could get my hand on about this lcd , i have faith that apple did this right .
i cannot believe it  .
the time has finally come  .
the 17 inch display on my pc laptop looks and works great  .
all i can say is awesome  .
i cannot say anything that has not already been said  .
this is , once again , hands down proof that apple makes products that the entire world should buy .
simply put , this lcd monitor is the best of its kind  .
the crystal clear picture , perfect geometry , and bright , accurate color you've been hearing about with apple's studio display series  .
it's all true  .
if you're in the market for an lcd monitor , make it this one , even if you need to purchase a few adaptors to make it work with your current system  .
you wo not regret it .
the apple flat displays for pcs what a great idea  .
apple if you are listening , this is an excellent way to increase market share  .
the apple studio display is not just for apple computers anymore  .
everyone should have one for their pcs  .
or , even their laptops  .
with a dviator at drbott  .
com and a pcmcia pc card from margi  .
com will open up a new world for pc users  .
display    to    go 4mb is a type ii cardbus pc card with adapter cables for use with dvi , dfp or vga displays  .
these displays can be a crt , digital or analog lcd display , projector , plasma display or head wearable display  .
stated simply , it's a pcmcia graphics adapter card for laptops  .
do not walk run to purchase a apple display for your pc .
best monitor i have ever owned  .
not only is it perfectly sharp , bright and perfect in reproducing colors , it is also wonderfully integrated with the g4  .
the touch panel for startup , sleep , wakeup , and the one that takes you automatically to the display control panel work great , and are truly cool .
clear , bright , and color rich display i traded a 21 inch crt and have no regrets about it  .
text is sharper by far  .
no geometry problems to try and fix .
its an absolutely beautiful piece of work  .
cnet's ratings only confirm this  .
the few people who have rated it a thumbs down speak for themselves  .
its as if they are simply voting becasue they hate macs  .
lcds don ; t need many controls , there is no need for geometry settings becasue of the fact that it is an lcd display and color is handled by apple's colorsync  .
brightness is the only thing you need to worry about  .
i feel for those who have to spend the few extra bucks for the dvi connection but for those who have adc and all other macs in the future  .
this is a really nice feature which cuts down on the need for more than one cable to supply power , usb and video signal  .
i love it .
when you see this display you will realize why apple makes better computers  .
you can even attach this cool display to your older mac with a special cable .
despite being a graphic designer of many years , i made the jump to lcd with this display  .
i'd trust no other company than apple  .
i'm happy to say , they got it right  .
traditionally , lcds have had so    so color and brightness  .
not so with this display  .
it is brighter , equally color accurate , and crisper than my old apple 17 crt  .
by the way , for those (including the author) saying that the display's connector is proprietary   you are misinformed  .
it is not just an apple technology , but a dvi+ connector , an industry standard that apple has just been the first to adopt  .
instead of criticizing apple for embracing a new standard , why are not you complaining to traditional display manufacturers because of their inability to keep up with the times  .
i dont know how there could be a better monitor  .
the single adc connection is a dream come true  .
one cable , and i can power my mac right from the monitor  .
the viewing angle on this is so good , i cant put my head in an area where the color seperates  .
this is just an insanely great monitor .
i plan on buying two  .
even with buying the dvi converter and a second video card , it's cheaper than one 22 cinema display and you have more screen realestate  .
apple sells an adapter for computers that don't power their own dvi displays  .
it essentially turns this display into a basic dvi display , with a basic dvi plug and a power cable  .
the adc connector is not proprietary , it's a dvi+ connector  .
apple is just the only one using it right now  .
it contains a standard dvi signal , as well as a standard vga signal , as well as a standard usb signal , as well as ac power  .
it is a joy to use these displays on macs , though , because the mouse plugs into the keyboard , the keyboard plugs into the display , and the display plugs into the computer  .
also , the colorsync feature of mac os x ensures that what you see on the screen is what you get  .
there are no controls that need to be set  .
you just plug in the display and get right to work , with a pristine picture  .
there are lots of other nice touches , too  .
if you need to work at a lower resolution , the low    res picture is scaled up and anti    aliased to fill the screen , rather than showing it in the middle of the screen with black around it , like on some other displays  .
full digital operation means that it responds quickly for full    motion video and games , without the ghosting seen on analog flat panels (those with vga connectors)  .
you cannot go wrong with one of these  .
you'll get years and years of a perfect picture , and the design and style of the unit are a pleasure to work with  .
tilting the display can be done from the front with one hand  .
very accomodating product  .
ps it's been a while since apple's products were typically more expensive than comparable peripherals from other companies apple just includes everything you need and does not cut corners  .
you pay the same in the end no matter who you buy from , but it's a lot less work to buy from apple  .
you buy , you work , end of story  .
no messing around with things and hoping that software/hardware from three different companies actually works when you get it set up  .
apple just puts it in one package for you , and then takes responsibility if you need support instead of passing the buck .
i am awaiting my display along with an 867 mhz g4    but have spent alot of time with one in a store  .
if you have not seen one in person , you will instantly be amazed at the brightness and clarity of this display  .
apple has been historically knocked for it's high priced hardware , but this display is very competitively priced , especially when considering the quality  .
you simply cannot buy a better 17 cld anywhere  .
period .
i've seen a lot of flat screen monitors , and apple's products consistantly rank tops in my book  .
it works beautifully with my g4 cube and i can use parts of my desk i have not seen in years .
after trying to rig a samsung 170t via a dvi    to    adc adapter , i bought one of these as soon as they came out  .
a perfect match for the g4 , and the screen quality is superior to anything else i've seen (even at non    native resolutions below 1280x1024)  .
true , if you don't have an adc based machine this won't work for you , but that does not affect the value for those that do  .
(sorry , i've already sold my 170t  .
as always , apple leads the way with superb quality and styling in this very nice display  .
also , a third party adapter is available to enable use with older macs  .
for you pc users , dell and gateway will have their copies out in a year or so .
i replaced my trusty 17 sony sfii with this display  .
it is fantastic  .
text is sharp , colors are vivid and images in general are amazing on this lcd  .
i use a sony 21 crt at work and this lcd blows it away  .
with 1/3 the power consumption of a crt , 1280 x 1024 (same as my 21 ) resolution and the flicker free crisp display you cannot go wrong with this display  .
by the way , my old 17 crt cost nearly the same (6 1/2 years ago) as this lcd cost now .
i just loved it from the moment i first let my eyes on it  .
you know the feeling you get when you see your love at first site yeah that feeling  .
) its a perfect gizmo to show off to your friends , whether its on or off , cuz either way , it looks awesome  .
great quality  .
there is a big difference between this and other flat panels color is much better and so is the quality of the picture in general .
there is comments here about people being concerned about using this monitor with old g4s  .
i have an original g4 , without adc or dvi  .
i wanted this montitor so bad , so i bought an ati radium pci graphics card , and the dviator  .
it took me a few hours (and some browsing of apple's support discussion group , where i got great help) , to get all the features working (like brightness control) , but now it works great , and i am very impressed with it  .
remember that the usb is not just used for a hub , but controls like brightness is sent over usb also , so it needs to be plugged in  .
this is not just a monitor , its a work of art  .
completely worth the extra hardware i needed .
after buying this display for my g4 cube , i fell in love with it  .
i wanted one for work  .
so , i purchased a video card with a dvi+ connector , and the display , and it worked perfectly  .
adc is not proprietary  .
it's just apple's name for dvi+  .
this display should work beautifully for anyone with a dvi+ graphics card , as it did for me  .
people should not be so quick to assume it wo not work  .
the only thing i wish were here would be a better way to swivel , raise or tilt  .
but the small footprint and gorgeous screen more than make up for that quibble .
i own viewsonic and sgi flat panels , they do not even compare  .
i know that the biggest problem seems to be with the ultra    top    secret adc connector , but i think the single cable idea is soooo impressive that it's worth the upgrade card  .
i found that i can stare at this display for hours without the fatigue that the viewsonic and sgi screens provide  .
i'm very happy with this apple product  .
this is the best screen i've seen  .
nothing bad to say about it at all  .
and it looks great too  .
thank you apple  .
i have purchased probably 30 computers and monitors over the last 15 years , including 21 supermacs , 21 sony trinitrons , 17 viewsonics , and others    this monitor is the best of them all  .
i spend all day in front of it and am much less fatigued at the end of the day  .
and it is simply gorgeous to look at    even when off .
no doubt about it , you could buy another 17 lcd for less than 17 lcd from apple , but for look of plastic design , the brightness and sharpness of the apple's lcd , it stands out like no other displays , it's very much apple's dna , simply the best 17 lcd you can buy for under 1k .
i love this panel  .
i bought it on a pure whim  .
i had the money and i wanted to blow it on something , and well i got this for my g4 cube  .
its incredible  .
ive never owned a flat panel for a desktop before this one , and i is amazed when i plugged it in  .
it blows away my mitsubushi diamond pro 2040u monitor in crispness  .
i love lcd's so much i ordered a planar 18  .
1 for my pc  .
once you go lcd you cant go back .
this is the best monitor i have ever had or seen for the money  .
very pleased with it and worth every penny  .
the only downside is the connectivity you need a a model with adc for it to work but there is alternative options for connecting it to older macs but they are costly .
one of the nice little things thats come about with this display is the reduction of cable clutter  .
one cord (the adc) hooks into the back of my mac    no power cord  .
and the two usb ports let me plug in the keyboard and graphics tablet close    again , reducing the clutter  .
screen quality is perfect low desktop profile is amazing resolution is so fine , i need new desktop pictures adc makes life a breeze need to get more attractive peripherals , now makes me want a nicer looking desk a nicer looking apartment nice looking clothes my credit card will not survive .
i work at a computer store and this is the best lcd of  any  size i've seen  .
i have always been a big fan of viewsonic's professional series of crt monitors , currently using a pt755 (17 )  .
well now i can barely stand using them this lcd is so good  .
good value for money too .
it�s simply a piece of art  .
incredible  .
irresistible  .
only a pc�er    man wouldn�t love it .
i 've been using one for about a week now  .
it replaced my old 17 crt and what a difference  .
it's absolutely gorgeous to look at and is so bright and crisp  .
a huge screen yet it takes up so little room  .
and this has to be the easiest screen ever made when it comes to installing it just one simple plug and away you go  .
wonderful lcd screen what more can i say its a screen  .
its wonderfully brite and it looks awesome on my desk  .
huge screen area , very small footprint  .
replaced a 19 inch cybervision c92 crt and could not beleive how much better the lcd is  .
text is sharp and clear , colors vibrant with superior brightness  .
does not heat up my room like the crt did  .
i can even turn on my computer , and monitor control panel from the display  .
very cool  .
cnet review is incorrect on older macs being excluded  .
i'm running it on a b w g3 450 mhz with a ati radeon card with a dvi to adc adapter ($149  .
99) wich is not very pricey  .
it includes the adapter and a apple power supply  .
monitor really looks beautiful  .
really cannot say enough about it  .
if you have the means , i highly recommend picking one up  .
only one negative is the radeon card will not support all the lower resolutions below native 1280 x 1024  .
which is the falult of the video card , not the monitor  .
resolutions i tested are   640 x 480 regular stretched (ok)    800 x 600 regular stretched (ok)    1024 x 768 (not ok)    1280 x 1024 (ok)  .
give it a 9 out of 10  .
thank you for your attention .
fabulous monitor , without question  .
however , might we have a 3    year warranty , please  .
(after just purchasing this monitor , to replace a barely 2 year old apple 17 crt studio display that just up and fried (it , also , is an incredible display) , the warranty becomes a _huge_ issue .
i searched far and wide to find the right flat panel monitor to complement my quicksilver g4  .
i read many of the reviews on cnet and decided to take the plunge on the apple monitor  .
sure it is more expensive than other brands , but after many trips to many different stores i had yet to find one that looked as good as the apple monitor connected to a g4 via the adc connection  .
my only concern about the monitor is how good it would look for fast    paced , fps    style games  .
i needn't have worried  .
it looks great  .
i have not seen any ghosting or lag in the pixel response  .
colors look fabulous , both in games and in digital pictures or video  .
other pluses   single cable to the computer  .
very clean  .
also provides a two    port usb hub , which is quite convenient for peripherals such as digital camera card readers and the like  .
possible minuses (which could be viewed as a plus in some sense)   there is only a single brightness control , which activates the system control panel when you press it  .
no contrast control , which makes it tougher to fine    tune the picture quality  .
this can be done by other means (e  .
, using a calibration program such as supercal) , but it would have been nice to have a simple contrast control  .
other considerations   1280x1024 is a bit dense for a 17 monitor  .
smaller fonts get pretty small  .
on the other hand , you need pretty dense resolution to get a pleasing effect with the anti    aliasing used by os x , so there's a tradeoff there  .
i've become accustomed to it , but people susceptible to eye strain might want to think about getting at least an 18 or 19 monitor at this resolution .
no pixel lag time , no blurring or shadowing , nothing but crystal clear quality worth the price  .
a 23 widescreen version is even better , but 4 grand is a bit steep .
the screen looks excellent  .
it looks agreat on my desk  .
you can power up and put to sleep the cpu from the power button on the display  .
usb connector on back of display .
i sold my 15 inch lcd apple display (too small for my taste)i wanted the apple 22 inch lcd but for 2499 is way over priced , i instead got the 17in apple display and im glad i did in just one word wow until you see one in person you won't beleive the picture on this baby  .
again i say wow get one now i swear you wo not be sorry  .
at first i was not sure how good the lcd quality this monitor will be , cause the quality i saw in the retail stores did not impress me at all  .
but this apple 17 monitor blew my mind away  .
sharp image , excellent pixels , and beautiful design  .
love it  .
highly recommanded  .
if you have the money to get the 22 cinema display , go get it  .
it certainly worth the money  .
apple did it again  .
as a visurally    impaired user , the bright screen and especially the high contrast more than make up for the reduced size , compared to 21    inch crt monitors .
i have used several different monitors , in a variety of sizes and from a fair number of manufacturers  .
this monitor has form and function  .
if the cost is agreeable to you , there is nothing better to compliment your new g4 mac .
despite the fact that i needed to purchase a dviator adapter , this lcd is by far the crispest , cleanest monitor i have ever seen  .
the software that came with it does not work with the dviator so i'm stuck in native resolution for now but both apple and dr  .
bott say a fix in the works  .
the screen is actually larger than my previous 19 crt and the difference in clarity is outstanding  .
wish i could have afforded the 22 model .
to the guy who said he has used better , well put you money where your mouth is and name the monitor which is better  .
after all if you know a product that cnet apprently doesnt , why not share it  .
the most crisp display i have ever used  .
i is using a 21 inch monitor , but i hated the size on my desk  .
this monitor does not make me miss much about those few extra inches  .
it is very nice to not have to break your back setting it up  .
my crt is around 65 pounds  .
i wish it is cheaper , but it is worth every penny .
this is intended to be a second monitor , but after running it side    by    side with my 21 sony crt , i could stand the contrast between the two  .
the crt is now in another room .
i'm using one of these beautiful displays right now , and it's without question the best monitor i've ever had  .
(and also the most expensive ) the picture is crystal clear , the casing is gorgeous , and the two built    in usb ports and power switch that also controls my mac all add up to an expensive monitor that is actually worth the money  .
however , one caveat this monitor uses the newer apple adc connector that is only present on newer macs  .
(even some early g4 units do not have the connector  .
) the unit's picture looks best in its 1280x1024 resolution , but lower resolutions still look very very good , just not quite as crisp as the native resolution  .
the adc connector between the monitor combines digital signal with power and usb connectivity all    in    one , so while it limits the audience for this monitor , it makes it incredibly convenient  .
if you are able to take advantage of this monitor , i strongly encourage you to do so  .
simply awesome  .
for those of you who have always yearned for the 22 apple cinema display but simply cannot spend the $2499 on it , this is the monitor for you  .
it shares the same style as the cinema display , and uses an extremely high quality piece of tft  .
viewing angle is wonderful , at 160 degrees (just like the cinema display) and with a native resolution of 1280 by 1024 , you get the same vertical resolution as the cinema display and plenty of screen space  .
simple to install , and overall , you get alot for just $1k .
i spent about an hour in the new apple store (va) playing with everything , and one of the things with which i is most impressed is this screen  .
i used it for at least 20 minutes and even days later remember thinking how much better i liked it than my current crt  .
i also played with the 22 which is very impressive , but almost seemed well too big  .
compared to the 17 anyway .
a bright , sharp display  .
going from crt to this lcd makes computing a new experience  .
bott makes an adapter so older g4's with a radeon card will work  .
check dr  .
bott's website for info on compatiablity  .
great quality display at a good price  .
too bad i bought the 15 model before the 17 debutted .
if is a great way to watch your dvd's or really it is also great for detailed game play with high graphics games like unreal tournoment .
one cable for power/usb/digital video  .
yes  .
it makes sense and is simply a good example of good design  .
apple should license (or whatever) it out to other vendors .
although a lot has been said about the proprietary connection , its a breeze and solid too  .
just watch out for the software install .
the very thing that makes the mac great is also one if its biggest drawbacks    compatibility  .
because apple controls the whole user exprience , it can make better products  .
this display (i do not own one but have seen it in action at the apple store) is excellent based on its design , quality and price , and if it were an industry standard dv display , i would think apple could sell a ton to pc users  .
but because apple contols the technology , they have made the user exprience just a bit better  .
i have used adc (apple display connector) based monitors , and it may seem like a small thing , but there is joy in hooking up just one cable for power , video and usb  .
it's elegant , it's easy , and i'm glad i'm a mac user .
while the display could use more image adustment controls , the picture is so good you rarely miss 'em .
the only real issue with image quality is latency on some fast moving games or movies  .
however , apple changed the connector from dvi to adc , so to even use the display on my early g4 i had to buy a $150 dvi to adc converter  .
(the apple unit seems identical to the dr  .
bott unit  .
) the adc connector draws power from the video card , which also limits the video cards older macs can use with this display  .
however , i found that for pc's ati and nvidia video cards (mine's is geforce4 ti4600) can work the the converter , the only thing you lose is the brightness and contrast controls  .
i now have a fantastic apple display running on my pc .
compared with the apple studio 21 monitors this 17 lcd is incredible  .
i could not afford the cinema display (more than twice the price for a bit more width) , but i am extremely happy with this monitor  .
i have two of them , on two different machines  .
i love the fact that i have recovered a vast amount of desktop space (literal , not virtual desktop  .
i recently picked up the 17 studio display along with the dvi to adc adapter to see if it would work with my windows pc with a geforce4 ti 4200  .
the clarity of this model blew me away in the store so i had to give it a try  .
the good news   it works  .
the picture on this monitor is totally and completely awesome  .
it is in a different league than any lcd screen that i have seen especially in this price range  .
the bad news   (for pc users) you can not control the brightness (it is very bright) and the usb cable has to be connected after you boot up in order to use the hub  .
maybe this problem is not common  .
if anyone knows , please post a response  .
apple out did themselves with this one  .
it is a truly amazing display  .
i is reluctant to put away my 19 crt for a lcd but that crt will be staying in the closet  .
after the price drop , it is by far the best 17 display out there for picture/text quality and value .
a beautiful monitor that failed 13 months after i purchased it  .
reading through e    bay and talking to some apple techs and it is clear that i am not alone  .
apple charges $525 to fix a monitor that they sell for less than $700  .
what a rip off  .
i saw many apple studio display 17 's  .
all of them had very good screen uniformity  .
uniform brightness , color , contrast , sharpness , focus  .
so i understand why this is more expensive than other 17    inch lcd's  .
however , apple studio display 17 flickers  .
if you are sensitive to screen flicer like me , this lcd monitor is not for you .
sure , it is a nice display , and works fine with the g4 however , apple has broken our heart by denying the rebate promised at purchase  .
the $300 rebate on the 17inch , made this lcd somewhat more price worthy at the time  .
make certain you get the rebate info off the web page  .
(the apple store doesn't tell you the forms wo not be coming with the product)  .
also you will have only 30 days to comply starting at the day of purchase  .
it in not business days either  .
(which is why they claim they will not honor our rebate)  .
it is ugly that a simple post mark (tardy two days) is the reason apple has decided to dog a loyal costumer since the 80's  .
the products they make are more expensive , and we believed we were supporting a cool company  .
(we have four of their computers now)  .
we might shop cheaper elsewhere from now on .
the sleep switch tends to activate whenever   the barometer changes , the temperature increase , people walk by , or when it's feeling cranky  .
so the system keeps going to sleep in the middle of projects .
for the price i paid for this , i could have gotten an 18 lcd with equally good image quality , like the nec , samsung , or eizo .
looked okay for a half hour , then it got wavy , like an old tv  .
apple did not seem like they were real interested in helping , they just told us to send it back and they'd get a new one  .
it is expensive anyway .
it is a nightmare buying this screen and discover that apple changes the standard for the same g4 cpu model , making it impossible to plug in the screen into a 1st or 2nd generation of g4 computer  .
no pre and post    selling support , bad (or none) upgrade possibilities (you cannot replace the video card) , and expensive patch adapters (with limited resolution options , and problems to install new extensions)  .
what were they thinking when they decide to go smart and change the standards to plug in a screen  .
dvi to adc  .
maybe technically adc is a better solution , but the smart designers did not offer an alternate connection option for old users of an apparently same cpu model  .
it is very frustrating felt left apart from apple , a company that used to respect standards in design for the operating system and software , but no any more with the hardware  .
i remember the times when everything is plug and play .
as a use it might be an good thing but the retro look is just one of the ugleist things i've ever seen  .
i used better lcd's with more controls and better color quality  .
viewing angle is sub    par .
an electrician came to fix some electical problems in my apartment  .
he cut the power while my computer is on  .
even though it is on a surge protector , the monitor is fried  .
it prevented my computer from booting up when it is plugged into it  .
after a year and a half of use , i've had to wonder whether this piece of hardware will las another day  .
less than half a year after purchasing it with my g4 the panel started to show a dimmed lower half  .
bad sign  .
into apple it went for under    warranty repair  .
now , half a year after the warranty expired the top half of the display goes bad  .
apple will not allow anyone else to do the repair which runs into the hundreds to have apple do it  .
a good monitor should last a little longer than that , especially since it costs a small fortune  .
what a disappointment in apple  .
they used to be a company with heart  .
no more it seems  .
it's beautiful to look at , but if it does not work it's a sorry $1000 paper weight  .
apple should stick to computers  .
this , like every other apple monitor i've used in the last five years , came with simple flaws in manufacturing  .
when you find a good one , it's great , but not any better than the competition  .
trouble is , their quality control is bad and you may not want to risk the hassle of returning the product , especially since you will probably have to ship it back to apple and are not able to exchange it at a nearby store .
the future of all pc displays , this type will send the old crt's to the dumpster  .
crisp , brilliant , and especially eye    popping when linked with a second monitor to unclutter the screen of toolbars and menus  .
unquestionably the way to go , but still pricey  .
come on , competition , let's drive those prices down  .
the response time is pathetic to todays standards in lcd  .
you're better off buying something with a better response time  .
it's also not value for money  .
if your laying out the cash consider buying a monitor that will work with most systems  .
the apple dvi is , as usual , non standard .
this screen is so bright that brightness control needs to be turned down well below the midpoint  .
it would make a great tv screen .
beautiful display  .
bright , crisp , easy to use  .
wonderful  .
better than any other lcd display i've seen .
porn looks great on this screen  .
plus the flatscreen feature makes it easier to clean  .
unleash the true power of the internet .
