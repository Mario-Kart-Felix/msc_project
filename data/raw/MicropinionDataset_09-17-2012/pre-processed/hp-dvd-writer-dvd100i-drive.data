i bought my hp100i through best buy , then had gateway install it on a monster pc that i had built  .
i had problems until a week ago because i wanted to use memorex cd    rw  .
i could not reliably store data on these discs but then i used the hp cd    rw and dvd+rw and they work great  .
in all fairness to memorex i did buy a 5 pack of dvd+rw at best buy ($40)and they seem to work fine  .
i have already used this unit for a system back    up and it served well  .
think about it    an ide drive that will support an unlimited storage capacity  .
my regrets to all those who have had compatiblity problems  .
please do not be so hard on this product  .
tigerdirect has it for $299  .
i have already used it and it's great  .
i do not care about the dvd+r standard and tiger's $6  .
99 media kicks butt in pricing  .
i have no compatibility problems with the 6 different drives i've tested  .
it's just plain great  .
constantly have problems with the door mechanism , sent back first unit because the door did not open at all  .
in this unit , the door only works periodically  .
this dvd/cd burner is very easy to set up and use  .
i have rendered and burnt 3 family video dvd's from my digital camcorder  .
the dvd+rw worked perfectly in my dvd player (sanyo)  .
the rewritable media is a bonus because if you screw up your not out a disk  .
i would recommend this drive to anyone  .
i do not know where some of these people cannot get the burned dvd to work , but i guess they're all retarded  .
my burned dvd+rw works in all the dvd players i tried it on .
so far , so good  .
all the dvd drives i played my burned dvd works  .
tried it on my xbox also , and it worked great  .
buy this dvd+rw drive  .
i took the dvd    r to the good guys store and test it with all the dvd player available and it doesn't not play  .
tech support does not answer my calls (waited for almost 20 mins)  .
great compatibility (compared to dvd    ram and dvd    r drives)  .
low price , excellent performance  .
blow the not    so    super    drive out of the water  .
i purchased an hp computer with this dvd+rw drive  .
i've created several dvd's with home video and backed up many files  .
its great  .
the only issue is that some dvd players do not currently play dvd+rw discs  .
but hopefully this will change as more products support this technical spec  .
also , it seems that their is a lot of confusion about the differences between dvd+rw and dvd    rw media ; make sure to always check twice  .
even on the hp site they mislabel dvd+rw media as dvd    rw , an important distinction .
this dvd writer has a much faster formatting time than its competitors and works on more dvd readers than any other dvd burners on the market  .
this thing supports all the current standards and allows users to store unheard of amounts of data to dvd at home for $500  .
it is a no brainer .
the hp dvd    writer dvd100i works great to store movies  .
dvd+rw media works on 1 of 3 dvd players i've tried  .
read this for so called compatibilty issues    the dvd writer 100i is compatable with dvd    r's if only everyone had winxp's built in writing software to record them , i can even copy dvd's  .
i ve already recorded the matrix  .
u probably think im making this up , try it (seriously it works) .
it is awesome  .
i bought it in the afternoon , installed it quickly , and burned a dvd as well as a cd  .
i recommend it to anyone who wants to burn dvds fast  .
had a little trouble with the udma , had it turned off in the bios but not in win2k device manager  .
after that the drive seems very stable  .
the video has played on two of three home dvd players with no problems  .
i have a piii 800 which is a little shy of the best qulity video 1 hour .
i really like this drive  .
i didn't have any installation problems cds burn fine and even though the cd burning option of the drive is not lightning fast (12x) it's still fast enough for me since i is using an 8x cd/rw before this  .
i haven't burned movies onto dvd yet so i don't know well that works but i did back up 8 gb of video files from my hard drive with no problems at all  .
that is really valuable space i cleared up and these were files i couldn't delete because i might have to work with them again in a few months  .
i've had  .
no buffer under    run errors at all and i've burned a lot of cds with this drive  .
if you have the money , don't be scared  .
this drive is worth the money if you can benefit from the storage it offers  .
one bad thing nero burning rom does not recognize this drive so you're stuck using hps software  .
but it seems to be livable .
i've been waiting for a long time to make dvds and now i finally can cost effectively  .
i bought it at 9  00 and not only had it installed but had my first one hour video dvd burned the same night  .
it truly did exceed my every expectations  .
the software bundle is complete , installation a breeze , and i is able to find dvd+rw disks easily and reasonably priced .
very good cd burner and good dvd player , nice choice of software that came with it and very east install but when it came to writing a dvd movie playable in a dvd player i just couldnt wait around 2 days , yes it is an extremely large movies but 45 minutes to get to 3 percent , get out of here , wouldnt recommend for large file dvd burns  .
the burned dvd doesn't work with my sony or toshiba dvd player  .
the only way to view it is from your computer  .
in short do not buy it .
after putting the patches on for xp , i is making movies without any problems  .
the software is very easy to use and everyone loved the movie that i produced from my minidv camcorder  .
the media is re    usable  .
so you can play with different features and not blow $10+ every time you create a test burn  .
so far it plays in the xbox , my gateway laptop and other computer dvds  .
my sony dvd on my home theater doesnt work , but it cant even play cdrs  .
i would buy it again .
all who complain about lack of compatibility with dvd    r just wait for dvd+r disks , which should be out in early 2002  .
the cost of dvd+r should be comparable to dvd    r  .
the existing players should support dvd+r after firmware upgrade .
just got one , needs a high end macking to work efficiently , but seems to perform as promised  .
nice to have home movies on dvd format and goodby to older back    up storage mediums    4  .
7 gb per disc is real nice .
slowly i think i'm becoming an hp groupie little by little my system seems to be getting replaced with hp products  .
they have never let me down and are very user friendly  .
love it  .
installed almost as easily as a cd    rom ; easier than some cd    rw's i've installed  .
and lives peacefully in my machine with the nec 7700 cd    rw which came with it  .
good collection of software , too .
the software provided does not even provide a means to master non    video dvds , and the hp simple backup is laughable  .
but , once i installed nero and burned a disk , i decided this drive is worth the $300 i paid  .
i recommend it for those wishing to burn quickly it burned 4  .
5gb in 23 minutes not too shabby  .
the hp site indicates that disks created by the drive are compatible with the sony dvp s 550d , but not in my experience  .
don't assume that the hp list of drives is written in stone , as the fine print and experience shows that it is not  .
other than that , it's a decent drive  .
just do not expect your video disks to play on aunt eunice's dvd player .
the drive installed ok , but had to remove the adaptic software i use to connect to my sony mavica cd    r digital camara ( install software said it is incompatable )  .
but over all i like the 4  .
7gig per disk capacity  .
have not created any dvd movie disks  .
i give it a thumbs up for those who need large offline storage .
in case you're wondering , my own experience showed that dvd+rw video disks from original material created with this drive did play back on the microsoft x    box but not ps2  .
and the good thing as that the video looks great playing back on nice , big , bright tv  .
the discs created (hp , verbatim) can be played on my sony dvp    ns400d player with very good results at 6mbps encoding rate , provided they are written directly onto the disc using the authoring software  .
mydvd 3  .
0 (bundled) , dvdit  .
se 2  .
5 and ulead dvd moviefactory are the ones that i have tried and they all worked  .
i tried making dvd to harddisk , and then copied the video_ts and audio_ts files to the dvd+rw discs using hp recordnow but it will only play with software players (powerdvd , windvd)  .
you can find a long list of compatible players in http  //www  .
vcdhelp  .

do not get the mydvd plus 3  .
0 from sonic because it is virtually identical to the hp's bundled software , and just as buggy (a lot of unknown errors messages)  .
however , dvdit  .
se 2  .
5 works great , and has much more flexibility than mydvd 3  .
one thing i am not comfortable about is hp's promised availability for a firmware upgrade for dvd100i to support dvd+r  .
i read from other websites (www  .
dvdplusrw  .
org forums)that it may not be available after all , and that hp is almost ready to ship dvd200 model which supports dvd+r  .
otherwise this drive is great  .
it also works as a fast rw drive , equivalent to a 21x cd    rw  .
the formatting time is less than two minutes , which is much faster than a 4xcd    rw disc (20+ mins  .
i have a p4 (1  .
3 ghz) , 768 mb rdram , and separate 7200rpm harddisks for dv capture .
mpeg    4 compression technology should come bundled with this device  .
hey , i could careless for what kind of dvd discs it needs to burn , as long as i can burn my regular cdrs and watch dvds , its all good  .
i recently bought a new system   1  .
7 p4 , d850 intel chipset , win xp  .
i am a complete novice when it comes to pc hardware (always took it to store for memory upgrades and h/w failures)  .
this installation is very easy , both from hardware and s/w installation  .
not one single problem  .
i is quite proud of myself when it is all done  .
(took about 2 hours)  .
however , the drive showed up as d , and not e (cd drive became e even though it is set up for master) i also installed an ati aiw radeon at the same time , again no problems  .
no problems with win xp either  .
made my first dvd yesterday  .
the s/w that hp supplies is not very intuitive and there is no user guide , just a lame duck help  .
all i wanted to do is burn an mp2 file from hdd to dvd ; authoring apparantly is what i had to do  .
it took 1 hour figuring out how this should be done , and then another 2 hours for it to create a dvd from an mp2 file  .
(30 minute video)  .
i need to explore other options to burn mpeg files to dvd , as most of that time is spent doing some kind of conversion (  .
) dvd played fine in my sony 360 dvd player , albeit a little digitized looking , even at the best setting  .
have not tried to burn a dvd directly from a video source yet  .
perhaps that will give me a better quality  .
did not have to call support , so no rating there  .
blank dvds are a little steep ($10 at buy  .
com) , but they are rewriteable  .
ordered this product from pcnation ($512)    fast shipping .
don't like the fact that it doesn't burn dvd    rs as advertised , but now that i know , i do not mind  .
i'll wait for the dvd+r  .
mydvd software is primative , i'd like more options in setting up dvd menus  .
otherwise , i am very satisfied with the product  .
i use pinnacle to edit my dv/analog videos and burn to dvd  .
direct    to    dvd works well also  .
hp really needs to clean up their website  .
poor support options on line .
the dvd support is great , easy to use and reliable  .
unfortuately , the software insists on removing any cd related software and refuses to acknowledge cd    rw disks created on other computers  .
since getting it i have been unable to use my cds  .
i wish they could seperate the cd and dvd support , even if it meant having to have a seperate cd    rw drive  .
but if you need a good dvd drive , this one is it .
can finally record from my mini    dv cam to a format i can just pop into my dvd player  .
does not work with my older dvd    rom drive , though  .
it's fast and also does great backups (around 1  20 for 4gb) .
for those who complained about dvd    r compatibility learn your technology before you speak  .
it's as if you're complaining that vhs vcr does not play betamax  .
or dvd player does not play laserdisc i think dvd+rw is the future , and the price will drop to a level that is affordable  .
those who complain about the cost of dvd+rw seem to forget the prices of dvd    rs just one or two years ago .
good choice for dvd    r/rw but it needs aditional hardware for best encode  .
p3    800 is minimal for this i recommend a p3    850 or faster for this dvd  .
would like to buy it , but the price tag is to much me  .
like the idea of rw for cd dvd , cool .
it is a great storage device if it can be read by other dvd readers  .
the purpose of backing up information is that you can retrieve it easily  .
the only way to do this is only through the hp100i once you burned the disc  .
other dvd readers do not recognize the disc after it is burned .
i oringinally gave the dvd100i a poor review ; i could not get it to work properly  .
my bad  .
i fail to install the correct ribbon cable that came with the drive causing data to be lost and the unit to not function correctly  .
it has since been fixed and works great  .
however , the technical support for the reader portion of the drive still leaves much to be desired (hp does not support the unit as a reader , only as a writer)  .
work fine for data storage , however seem to have problems reading the dvd+rw media , even from the hp 100i drive itself  .
going to try the pioneer and see what it offers  .
still an expensive choice .
i own the 9900 series the 100i but there is a problem with the software , when i installed the dvd software , the 9900 wont read blank discs on a p4 system with an asus motherboard  .
the software otherwise sucks  .
another thing is when you burn extra copies of your games they wont play them at all , for the most part new games excluding safe disc 2  .
burn with clone cd or blindwrite , but your dvd player will still have problems reading them  .
i also own the 8200 seris hp burner and it has no problems at all , all the burning software supports it and the burned copies operate fine  .
so to conclude , the firmware on the new burner products limits what software applications you can burn  .
the 100i drive will burn older games , not safe disc 2 , without any hesitation  .
the drive reads sub    channels , supports raw and dao , but new burning software does not support it .
remember when the first cdrw came out  .
2x burn at a truly horrific price  .
today 24x burn for the price of a night out with the guys  .
and what the heck are you going to use the dvd burner for backing up that 24k excel spreadsheet or copying planet of the apes  .
factoring in the price of the burner , the price of a blank dvd , the price of the movie rental , you'd be wise to forego the burner for the time being .
just what we've been waiting for    hope it's a practical solution and that it will be affordable soon .
they should make an external one that runs off of firewire and that would make it aaa    1  .
it would be better if the product be postponed to add windows xp support before it is available in the market .
hp supports the standard that's good for consumers in this device , unlike their cd    rw products wich do not support key features like reading and writing raw , dao , sao or subchannel data  .
i guess dell woke them up out of their sleep .
i bought this thing not realizing that dvd+rw and dvd    rw is more than the oem choice of labeling the package  .
it works great you can really dump a lot of backup data onto the discs  .
you can even copy dvd movies and watch them on your pc  .
but forget these dics working on your console dvd player  .
hp can kiss my but on this one , they blew it  .
and i heard they have nl plans to fix the compatibility problems  .
hencwe they release the dvd200i i'm hopeing some of us are duimb enought to shell out anither $600 and get what we hoped for in the dvd100i  .
only buy this if you are creatibng backups of your email/data/software purchases , etc  .
or copy dvd's and only want to watch them on your pc .
i got hp dvd100i last year with impression it will be upgradable to dvd+r  .
and now hp says you are a sucker to buy any hp new product  .

i just bought this from compusa  .
soon thereafter i found a retailer that sells dvd    r discs for $2  .
30 per disc  .
i got me a dozen dvd    r's  .
however i found out my hp dvd 100i doesn't accept the dvd    r's  .
i found out i needed dvd+r's  .
how confusing is that  .
very  .
try shopping for dvd+r on your favorite search engine and you'll know what i mean  .
and if you are lucky to find someone that carries dvd+r's , they start at $10  .
does not that bite  .
software support is bad  .
not a whole lot of cd    r software makers have support for the drive  .
i guess i have to be patient  .
best that people hold off from getting a dvd writer until prices drop and real standards and support emerge .
feels like beta vs vhs again albiet it does work well writing to +rw media and playback using the same drive  .
i found compatibility in other devices is poor prefer dvd    r so i took it back .
we've written data dvds with the included hp record now  .
reading them on the dvd100i is not a problem  .
but we've never been able to find any dvd reader that can read them       including several on hp's list of compatibles  .
moreover , the video dvds are not readable on several consumer dvd players , such as our sony dvpf5  .
looks to be rock    solid workmanship , installs easy , and decent selection of software  .
but get something else if you want to use the dvds with anything other than the dvd100i (maybe true of all dvd+rw media , but have not tried other drives yet) .
decided to purchase this item after reviewing the box at the local best buy  .
hp has a link on the box to www  .
com/go/windowsxp but , never states that it lacks xp compatibility (subliminal msg with the go/windowsxp part)  .
none of the software will work with xp  .
oh , if you like ezcd creator , kiss it good    bye  .
software will not work with any cd    r or cd    rw's that have open sessions (to drop and drag data) copy all of your open cd's b/4 you install  .
once the dvd support software installation is complete you  can not  install udf or ezcd to copy them while dla (drive letter access by veritas) is installed .
other than recording videos how does it perform as a back up device  .
i'll spend the money on a new machine if it replaces the cd , dvd , and the tape back    up device on our server any comments from the cnet viewer world  .
great idea , but would be better off scsi , really taxes your system  .
software took multiple installation iterations  .
presently waiting for an rma .
i is very happy that my new computer came with a dvd rw drive , that is before i found out about the compatability issues  .
i made a backup of my files on the supplied dvd+rw media and is unable to read the disk in the dvd player that also came with the hp computer  .
why put the drives together if they are not cross compatible  .
and now i find out that hp has no intention of upgrading their firmware so everybody that has a dvd100i will be able to write to dvd+r media is totally unaceptable  .
i have purchased 7 hp computers in the last 3 years as well as a few printers  .
i will have to think long and hard about buying anymore hp equipment .
what act of most cruelty not to include dvd    r functionality  .
and no warning on the box i thought rw would mean r too  .
dvd disks created with the record now software read back fine on the hp100i drive , but i could not read back the dvd's on the 3 different models of dvd drives that i tested  .
also could not record files from a network drive , all files had to be local to the same machine 100i drive is in .
unlike dvd    r/rw drives , the 100i drive does not offer a write once format so everything is stored on an expensive rewritable disc  .
it's like getting a cd writer that only writes on cd    rw media which wo not play on my home or car stereo  .
if it's just rewritable dvd , what's the advantage of +rw over the existing    rw format that already exists in dvd    r drives  .
dvd    r (like cd    r) is proven to be more compatible with existing dvd players and drives , it's more secure since it cannot be erased and now dvd    r media is being offered online for less than $3  .
00 a disc  .
compatibility , security and media cost are more important to me especially since the 100i drive price is higher than dvd    r/rw drives available on the internet .
purchased drive approx  .
9 mos ago ($450 at the time at staples , price came down to $395 one week later and when i inquired about a refund , staples essentially told me tough luck) and have had nothing but problems  .
when software bundled with drive is loaded , everytime a cd is put into the drive , i got a pfn list fault and an auto re    boot  .
several calls to hp tech support were either unanswered (msg  .
left) or the tech had no idea what to do  .
after all but giving up , i bought the new 2 cd installation and drivers set and , when installed , once again got the same results  .
my last call to hp resulted in nothing but pure anger  .
the tech said that without a serial number (even thought the drive is registered with hp) , he would not help me  .
after pouring over hp's convoluted web site , i finally found , tucked away in an obscure cyber    corner the fact that the dvd200i software and intel's app accelerator were incompatible  .
the article went on to say that intel is aware of the problem and would fix it  .
i took the intel app accelerator off and sure as the devil , it worked  .
however the first words out of my mouth to hp would be shove this drive up where the sun don't shine and the grass do not grow and , btw hp , stick with printers only .
i wouldn't recommend this even if hp were giving it away for free  .
i installed it on two different machines trying to get it to work and it never did  .
both machines were running piii or better with 256mb ram ; one with win98se and the other with winxp  .
both installs were able to read data and audio cds  .
but i couldn't get them to record cds in any format , and forget about recording dvds  .
i could not even get the thing to run a movie dvd  .
when trying to record cds/dvds i kept getting error messages saying bad or corrupt sectors were found on the disks       even though the disks were brand new , right out of the packaging box  .
when trying to play dvds , i kept getting a message indicating no disk is present in the drive  .
after hours of experimenting and calling into hp's support line , which is totally useless , i gave up  .
as best as i could tell , the software that they bundle with the device is 2nd rate from obscure 3rd parties       very cheesy and looks like a lot of thought is not put into the code  .
i bought the device on advice from an acquaintance       the price is irresistable       who had an identical unit and the only way he got his to work is to purchase different 3rd party software  .
i was not about to fork over more money so i gave up  .
this definitely proves the old adage       you get what you pay for .
due to the limitations of the drive , the hp started a trade    in programs for customers who want to change the model  .
(http  //www  .
com/support/dvd100i    trade    in)  .
unfortunately hp decided that just us , canada , europe and asia customers can do the trade    in  .
this position shows a big lack of respect to custormer from other countries of the world  .
i hope hp realize the mistake it is doing .
its worth the extra 5 mins of burning time to get a dvd    r drive dvd+rw is never going to be as compatible  .
also for the best compatability you should record at 1x anyway .
the dvd+r support firmware update  .
not possible  .
$100 for a drive swap  .
it is supposed to be free  .
this product should never have been let out the door  .
the software is alpha    grade , full of bugs and instabilities  .
useless as a backup device  .
formats media , then says it's read    only  .
go elsewhere .
a decent but overpriced cd    burner  .
only works on dvd+rw , got confused and purchased    rw a no    no  .
does not work with any other dvd drive except new 16x pioneer and surpeisingly the pioneer dvd    r drive  .
the a03 from pioneer is a bit slower , but it works with every drive i've tested it on  .
this drive is a terrible value unless you want to use it as removable disk hard drive .
properly configured and connected on its own cable , the dvd100i physical connection first slowed and then repeatedly crashed win98se  .
there is no tech support number and e    mail support is a 2    day event  .
i assume i got a lemon but without a reasonable support path , who knows  .
after 2 months , i have yet to burn a working dvd that plays on something other than my computer  .
otherwise , it is an expensive $600 cd burner  .
what a rip  .
yes it writes really fast , but who cares about that if you cannot put the dvd in any dvd player  .
i have a 1 year old samsung dvd player and the dvd constantly skipped  .
on top of that , it does not support dvd+r , which means you can only buy dvd+rw cd's at $15 each  .
it's going back to the store  .
if you buy any dvd burner that only uses dvd+rw , then you're just flushing your money down the toilet  .
and at over $500 , that's a lot of money .
i am currently on my second hp100i , do to the reason i thought maybe it is just a problem with the specific unit i had nope  .
same problem with this one when reading dvd's , either pre    recorded or personally created , i continually get errors or lock ups (and i know it is not my system it's a 1  .
5 ghz , and my old creative dvd worked just fine  .
support it's worthless when i called hp they told me that they don't even support the dvd read portion of the drive (what is that all about  .
they said i need to call powerdvd the ones who make the dvd player software guess what  .
i have problems no matter what dvd software i use note do not buy  .
i have yet to find a player that can play back the dvd video disks i've made with this unit  .
also , support does not seem to be very responsive , either by phone (never seem to pick up) or by email (have yet to hear back from them even after a couple business days)  .
if you're thinking of this unit to create dvd video disks to share with others , proceed with caution .
i am disappointed with software titles come with the package are not compatible with win xp  .
i should have bought a sony dvd+rw instead .
needs dvd    r burn ability needs scsi option why hp did not do it right  .
fyi    go to   http  //www  .
mandrakesoft  .
com/products/81/gaming    edition  .
bought a new dvd100i on ubid  .
contacted hp for support , but hp declined to assist because it is purchased on ubid  .
is able to contact retailer for rma  .
will see if the replacement works ; however , i've got to say that it seems like hp really does not care for the little guy  .
will most likely pass on an hp product unless they pay me to take it .
got it at compusa , sales clerk eagerly sold me a dozen dvd    r disks at $7  .
00 a piece , i also picked up a few dvd+rw at $14 a pop  .
great for writing cdr/w , no problem reading dvd , but can not write dvd+/    anything  .
so far vob software is the only thing that even recognizes that dvd+rw is in the drive , but even vob sotware refuses to write to dvd media in the dvd100i  .
all in all the package cost me right around $900  .
00 , my yamaha cdr/w cost $127  .
00 almost a year ago  .
and the $900 setup does no more than the $127  .
oo setup  .
nuff said  .
this drive is as bad as philips' old cdi drives that lasted about a week at my circuit city store  .
no r support  .
i don't care about erasing the disc to be used later  .
i want to save my video forever , without having to worry about accidental overwriting  .
this drive cannot handle r media , what kind of bad design is this  .
i use cd    rw drives for both cd    r and cd    rw recordings , why cannot these guys get it right  .
, don't you think that after cd    r/rw , the next step should be dvd    r/rw  .
of course  .
easy format to follow , but no hp does not support dvd    r , yet they say they are better than dvd    r/rw  .
what kind of crack are they smoking  .
that's like ford selling you a car with only 3 wheels and then they tell you 3 is better than 4  .
no sale here  .
buyer beware  .
not only does +rw suffer from terrible compatibility problems producing dvds that will actually work in any other drive , but the media is way overpriced  .
you can buy dvd    r media for a tiny fraction of what dvd+rw discs cost  .
imagine paying $3/disc (dvd    r) vs  .
$12/disc (dvd+rw)  .
plus , the software included with this unit is a joke , i do not know what these guys were thinking  .
i'm trading in my +rw and i've already ordered a dvd    r to replace it  .
i'd suggest the pioneer dvr    a03 .
i bought a sony dvd+rw burner and it plays in one of the 4 dvd players i have  .
if you are looking for a way to put your videos on dvd just plan on having to purchase a new dvd player for you and your friends and your family if you want to watch them  .
my sony is going back just as soon as my pioneer dvr    a03 comes in .
4 different software programs and the one for dvd is sooooo painfully slow its unuseable  .
i am very sorry i bought it .
hp claims dvd+rw compatibility in apex and panasonic dvd players  .
in my tests the video dvd+rws would not even load , nor did any data dvd+rw (mp3)  .
pc dvd    rom compatibility   led blinks but dvd+rw does not load  .
cdr and cdrw are no problem .
my hp experience has not been a good one  .
after the first year you pay for any help  .
every product i have purcased has not lasted more than a year  .
you like to pay top dollar for junk then buy hp .
hp says $25 to answer questions about compatability issues with major brand (memorex and verbatim) dvd+rw  .
only my included hp disk will write  .
say they wo not warrant my drive as is was sold to a vender as a refirb  .
i opened this drive and removed the hp seals and am fighting with wholesaler and hp over warranty  .
i sure as he  paid full price  .
all this on my hp 520w hooked to my hp scanjet scanner hp printer and digital camera  .
guess where my loyalty will not lay in the future  .
i had a hp cd/dvd 100i installed in a hp 7965 pavilion in april and it has never worked  .
hours on the phone , on my nickel , and all they can come up with is to defrag the hard drive  .
i did and it still does not work  .
the sound on a digital video or slide show cuts out about half way into each project , long (55 min  .
) or short (6 min  .
i burned a cd for use in a wedding and it skipped constantly  .
unable to play on my sony dvd player that is listed on the compatibility sheet  .
unfinished product sold as a complete solution  .
still looking for a consumer dvd player this thing will play on  .
c'mon cnet       why waste our time with the old products  .
show a review for the 200i , a much better alternative to the 100i  .
this product does not write data on a dvd    r or a dvd    rw  .
please read the web site as to what this product does  .

i have a sony dvp s330 dvd player that listed as compatible on the hp site guess what folks it tells me no disk is in the drive i unfortunately bought this drive as a retailer that must have had a few experiences like this because they will only allow me to return the drive for credit make sure you can return this piece of trash if you are stupid enough to risk it  .
do not buy this if you want to use dvd    r media  .
so if you plan on using only dvd    rw and only want this drive to read the disks you created , this is a good drive  .
however , if you want to burn dvd's so your dvd player on your set top or on your other computer can read them , but something else  .
as you can see in the basic specs underneath the user reviews , you'll notice 'drive type   dvd    r/w' not  .
this drive does not support    r and none of my dvd    video players support +rw  .
i took mine back and got me a pioneer dvr    a03  .
i have successfully burned 57 dvd    r discs and they all play on all our dvd    video players  .
if you want a quality product stick to pioneer .
i have tried dvd+rw and is deeply dissapointed  .
it's compatability is terrible i tried 10 different drives and only one read the disc  .
but i have had success with my sony rx    590g burning dvd    r and    rw  .
no coasters and i have made 50 all have been read in those ten drives .
i bought this drive thinking that i would be able to use it to copy movies and do all of the fun things you would normally use it for , but it wont play my copied movies anywhere else but in this drive  .
i have gotten another dvd    rw drive out there thats better and cheaper , never buy this one~~~ever  .
it's the first one out    hold out for the competition    and make hp create a more superior product because it is destined to be inferior  .
i saw this thing in my compusa sunday paper  .
it is advertised with the pioneer dvd    r media , but guess what folks thiscrap doesn't support dvd    r  .
i don't want $15  .
00 dvd+rw discs , i want the $6  .
00 dollar discs  .
hp , keep your drive  .
i'll spend my $$ on a drive that burns dvd r and rw  .
didn't you guys learn from the cd    r/rw experience  .
and to top it all there is no apple support  .
my teacher uses apple in his class  .
can i burn my class project on this drive with his computer  .
hell no  .
do not wait your money here  .
the compusa manager gave me my money back  .
yeah  .
go compusa  .
near as i can tell , hp has a huge compatibility problem  .
stick with pioneer dvd    r    now cheaper and much more compatible .
