Pros:. NTFS File System, Ease of use, new look, many more. 
Cons:. RAM and Hard Drive Usage.

Pros:. ALL the pretty colors The MSmonkey eats tux for breakfast!. 
Cons:. It wasn't created sooner That I can't sit in a tub full of XP and other microsoft related product..

Summary:. These reviews are always interesting. Windows controls more than 89% of all personal computers yet there are only 600+ reviews on this board. Mac holds a mere 11% and there is an excess of 2300+ reviews on their board (most of which are positive). Truth be told, Mac fans will post a review simply to post a review. Win reviews are usually completed by those who are pissed off enough to take the time. Its a passion thing. In any event, I am an ex-apple guru who is quite happy with XP and the support of the ENTIRE COMPUTER INDUSTRY. What can I say ... I love the dark side.. 

$$;
Summary:. I'd been having problems with my machine for nearly a year, I was nearly at the end of my rope. I installed the Windows XP upgrade a week ago on my Win98SE machine. Other than having to get new drivers and software for my devices (not much of a problem though with a cable modem), the installation went flawlessly. In fact, it nearly installs itself (only a bare minimum of user intervention). I followed the instructions on the CD which included analyzing my system for compatibility issues and I deleted/uninstalled anything I didn't need or that wasn't compatible with WinXP. My machine is working perfectly. Much better than it was with Win98SE. The upgrade solved the memory leak problem that used to have my machine seizing up every time I used it (also any time it sat idle...well...actually ALL the time). It runs much faster and definitely more reliably. I recommend this upgrade wholeheartedly. For your info, my machine is an 800mhz Dell. 256 mb RAM that started with the memory leak problem about a year ago when I got cable access. WinXP fixed my problems.. 

$$;
Summary:. I'm actually disappointed in the Windows XP upgrade from Windows 98. Why? Because I have nothing to do now. I have spent many years spending endless frustrating hours working all the glitches out of all the other Windows programs, so when I upgraded to XP, I expected endless hours of massaging. I had absolutely none to do, and now I'm lost. I don't know what to do with all that free time I suddenly found myself with. The faxing option actually works now with Word, and the mail option works too, and I even got Outlook Express 6 to actually work and without spending endless hours trying different configurations. And my strictly DOS programs -- no problem. I have a friend that bought the XP upgrade, but she upgraded from ME, and she has had nothing but problems. I half suspect user error, but it could be that ME is more jealous than 98. My other guess would be not enough disk space on her hard drive.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is the best OS to date. I had minor driver problems when I first upgraded, but most hardware manufacturers have updated drivers that were easy to install. XP has never crashed on me, and it runs all of my programs MUCH better then WinME did. I advise everyone to upgrade. The NT file system is great!. 

$$;
Summary:. Well I dont know about why people say this operating system is not good. What can I say? People are stupid. This is just not any different than everything else. People are so stupid to say that Windows XP is bad. The kernel not once crashed. It not once required a restart to fix a problem. It handles all programs for previous versions of Windows better. Computers with over 500mhz and 256mb of RAM will surely see the difference. It is worth buying. If you got a slow computer not worth trying to buy more RAM and processor to run it. Just buy a new computer when you can which comes with WinXP preinstalled. Best deal for your money and you wont have to take it to customer support for a long time. The Windows Update fixes are not even required since the initial final release is 100% stable due to the excellent beta tests. Its a must have for the serious multimedia user.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP came pre-installed on the new HP I bought (1.4 Ghz, 256 RAM), and after using Win 98SE for EONS (or at least that's what Win 98 makes it seem like), I have to say this is a VAST improvement. No more blue screen of death, looks divine, and does everything I need it to. A few issues with some older games, but compatibility mode has fixed that problem effectively. I'm no computer guru, but coming from someone who was skeptical about upgrading, GO FOR IT!. 

$$;
Summary:. So, I'm just an average guy. I'm not a computer whiz or programming master. I want something easy to use and reliable. Windows XP is just that. With Windows ME I was constant crashing and getting error messages. Not only have I found XP to be error free, but MP'3s play better, CD's burn faster, graphics look sharper, applications run faster, and the list goes on and on. Installation was quick and painless too. The only problems were that Norton Anti-Virus 2001 is incompatible, and so is Easy CD creator 4. But with the integrated CD burning capabilities of XP, Easy CD creator will be hardly missed. And purchasing Norton for $30 was no big deal. Again, all and all, if you have Windows ME, I highly recommend you upgrade. Everything is better, (from a point of view of just an average guy.). 

$$;
Summary:. Windows XP has got to be the best operating system that Microsoft has ever put out. It doesn't matter what PC company you go with, as long as you're working with Windows XP you're O.K. I mean, you could even build your own PC with a 1 GHz processor, a 20 GB hard drive, and 256 MB of RAM on the system, and you'd be just fine as long as you had the new Window's XP operating system on your PC. It is truly the great equalizer because it allows a cheap PC to compete with the big boys.. 

$$;
Summary:. When I first tried to install XP I got errors,crashes,the upgrade cd denied that I was entitled to the upgrade, but after hours of fighting I did get it to install. It runs very well, better than any previous version, hasn't evcen hinted at crashing and has great features. The best feature is the automatic upgrade finder. This one was money well spent.. 

$$;
Summary:. None of my drivers worked, and it's slow slow slow. Plus the interface is horrendous! One big step backwards.. 

$$;
Summary:. So what if it makes it too easy for newbies. It is also stable as hell. Vast improvement over 98. I had few/minor compatability issues with old software and no hardware issues with a 1999 PC.. 

$$;
Summary:. first off you idiot ou there that say this os sux are a buch of crybabies. I have not had a problem yet your computers must just suck and u don't spend enough time on them to get to know them. and you orblem must come from beta versions and istall XP over 98. The true computer guru knows you NEVER istall a OS over another OS. Congrats to Bill and the team on all there work.. 

$$;
Summary:. By now, you've probably seen all the "bad" reviews by people who 1. Haven't even tried XP yet 2. Are just plain biased against PC's and Microsoft I say, listen to your own thoughts. Who cares if Microsoft "copied" it off of Macintosh. I don't see an OS X dock anywhere, do I? And where's the trademark apple? If having a better interface for the PC means having a MAC rip-off, I'm all for it. Right now, I'm not even seeing any bad reviews based on the product itself. Many are actually giving "previews" of the product. I'm seeing, "Oh my god, Microsoft is a monopoly so don't buy it" etc. Get real. My high school friends and I are more mature than most of you people. Review the product as it is. Many people, including myself, don't care if Microsoft did this or that. We just want a stable, user-friendly OS. I just got XP and I find it to be an excellent OS. I LIKE the new interface enhancements. I LIKE the fact that it's based on WIN2000. My system is far more stable as a result. My frequent daily crashes and lock-ups have now stopped. I mean jeez. I'm certainly not switching to a whole new system such as a Mac and I'm sure a lot of people aren't ready either. And don't forget the bugs in OS X when it was first released. At least XP is more stable. I'm not trying to flame anyone but don't give the product bad scores because of a personal vendetta. I certainly dont want to flame the Mac and Linux users since I own an I-Mac and a system running Red-Hat Linux. However, I also need a history lesson on Windows. Comparing OS's is like comparing wheels. It's like saying, "Oh, the rubber wheel is a rip-off of our good-ol stone wheel, let's not use it". Use the product before you review it. Windows XP to me = "Thumbs up". 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using the preview program for a few months. XP reallt does work a lot better then ME.. 

$$;
Summary:. I believe XP to be the best - though I have not used it yet, I still know just about everything 'bout it PC-Assistant.net. 

$$;
Summary:. first of all, you know that technically you have to have a seperate copy for each computer you run anyway dont you? This OS has not locked on me once in two weeks. installation was also the most error free process i have seen since dos.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is the best since 95 stable , and make diffrent computer sys run better. If u dont like it dont buy it its as simple as that. I love it and will have it on all my computers. 

$$;
Pros:. IT IS STABLE-WIN XP HAS BEEN RUNNING OVER 4 WEEKS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.IT IS EASY TO USE-YOU CAN INSTALL SOFTWARE IN MINUTES,IN (RED HAT)LINUX YOU MUST USE HOURS JUST TO THINK,WHAT PACKAGE TO INSTALL.. 
Cons:. IT IS NOT AS FLEXIBLE AS RED HAT LINUX AND IT IS LESS SECURE.. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded my 98 S/E to XP and have not been disappointed. The only time I have to re-boot is when I down load something like a virus update and it tells me to. Its compatibility with my accessories is awesome. On some things I didnt even have to load the disk. Just plugged in the product and it worked. When I'm playing around and screw something up I cant fix the go back or set back feature is great. Just re-set my computer back a day. I have had XP now for about 8 months and I have not had a single problem with it. Just took a little getting use to where everything is. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded from Windows ME. Compatibility problems with XP is the only thing to be concerned about. Other than that, XP Home Ed. Upgrade is superior to Windows ME.. 

$$;
Summary:. I recently switched from the Macintosh platform because I could no longer afford the hardware. I must say that XP Pro has been simply awesome. Fast,Stable and filled with features. Microsoft's finest effort!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. Finally, an operating system that delivers what it promises. My computer is faster, my hard drive is running beautifully, and the look and feel is extraordinary! The only thing that surprised me was that most of my TSR programs (like "Gator", Instant Messenger, etc...) did not load up automatically after I upgraded. I had to go into each of those programs and tell it to "launch with windows" again. Hmmmmm... but a minor complaint compared to the big picture! I think Microsoft should come down on the price, though. For all the money they make, they could have charged HALF the price.. 

$$;
Summary:. A big improvement over windows 98. I have been using it for acouple of months now and it has never crashed, say goodbye to the blue screen of death.. 

$$;
Summary:. I couldn't decide if I should get win2000 or Xp for my new laptop. In the end I got XP. So far it has out preformed win2000. I am happy XP'er. 

$$;
Summary:. I decided 6 months ago to switch to Mac computers, but since I don't yet have the money I decided to upgrade to XP. I was so fed up with ME crashing almost daily that the stability of XP is great. Being aesthetically inclined, the move to a more artsy/Mac OS interface is something else that I appreciate. Like nearly all, I hate the Product Activation, but was too much of a sucker for the stability and attractive GUI to resist. Overall, I like it MUCH better than Windows 9x--it is faster, more stable, and more attractive.. 

$$;
Summary:. Yes, the win.XP is another cheap imitation of the MAC interface. and they do it without a shame, with a group of people that use their system blindly without trying other OSes, I've tried both windows and MAC, and of course i settled for a MAC.. 

$$;
Summary:. Love it, Love it, LOVE IT... The reason that I love it so much may be due to the fact that that I have been putting up with Windows98 for to long... 

$$;
Summary:. I have found no problems installing ALL my old 98/Me programs(new vius protection is allready on sale or on download). Its very stable unlike 9x and 2000 before it my trial version is working on 2 differing machines,you pay for what you get. Some people are moaning for the sake of it..... still. Linux variations have a lot of work to do now to catch up agin.. 

$$;
Summary:. I think its great, I could go into what everyone else has, but basically my pc runs better, with less crashes and freeze ups. I recommend xp to anyone. I have a cable modem and I am online basically 18 hours a day, everyday, without fail. I have yet to encounter a problem. Ive had xp almost a year now. GREAT PRODUCT!. 

$$;
Summary:. I like many got WinXP with a new computer (Gateway). I was uncertain at the start, but I now have to say that I really like XP much better. I probably should paid the extra $99 for the Pro version, but I didn't plan to use the extra capabilities. I thought I would have problems installing my scanner, webcam, cable modem, mouse, zip drive, etc. I had pulled out all my hardware drivers (like you normally have to do with Win98) just in case I needed them. Not once did I have to use those disks. Win XP recognized all my hardware without a hitch. All the software I installed went without any problems while running Norton Internet Security 2003. The one thing I would say is Don't install the newWindows Media 9 (beta) because it still has some bugs. The only way to uninstall it is through the system restore. You might want to invest in a good book on XP. I just can't understand why so many people are having problems with XP or for that matter Win 98. Win 98 rarely give me the blu screen of death, but it was no big deal. When I installed a piece of software or hardware, I just made sure all the memory resident software were disabled so I would not increase my chances of getting an error message. I also don't let Win XP take over those common tasks normally performed by other software manufactures (i.e., CD copier/burner, firewall, etc.) You just have to leave that stuff to other companies who have been doing it for a long time. I do have to say that XP's movie maker is a nice piece of software. I used on a couple of projects and it worked great. About the only complaint I have is that I wish it was more compatible with Win2K. My father and I tried to make a connection via webcam and we couldn't quite make it work. Seems WinXP(home) and Win2K don't quite talk to each other even if we both use MS Messenger. We're in the process of trying Yahoo's messager to see if anything changes.. 

$$;
Summary:. The multiple user profiles can be a pain, especially when you have traditionaly had one email account. With the multiple users one user can open email meant for another and the person it was meant for may never get it. There are ways around this, but it ought to be built in.. 

$$;
Summary:. I think M$ is finally getting down to business and creating a very nice looking and stable OS I hope they keep it up.. 

$$;
Summary:. Once again i really don't have the right to put my thumb down since i got my copy installed for free. You do have to activate it online tho to avoid piracy, but M$ is not concerned with 1 person using it 2 or 3 times, they are more intrested in catching big time bootleggers. This new operating system is very crisp and never crashes, it is not compatable with somethings but i work through it. XP is a good move, just don't get that plus add on pack.. 

$$;
Summary:. Upgraded from 98 on a p3 256 used for games &#38; music mainly,found everything to run a whole lot better.No real problem installing,had to contact my broadband connection provider &#38; download a patch for sony cd burner.Well worth the $$$$.. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought Windows XP Home Edition for my computer, and I think it's the best operating system yet. I was downloading 3 very large files, and playing an online game at the same time, and everything was as fast as could be! Thank God for Microsoft!. 

$$;
Summary:. After spending the last couple if years with win98, this is like a small miracle. where i would have to reboot 98 at least once a day, usually more, i have not had to do that with xp. For the increase in stability, its worth the money.. 

$$;
Summary:. This upgrade is only for the folks who upgraded from the previous windows nightmares, 3.1,95,98,98se,and winME. like with all the other upgrades things will not work!but the final product is worth the wait. smoother operation, better grafic support, stability,just works better than the rest. drivers for some hardware are hard to find and long on the downloads.some are non-existant.They could have done better in that regard.. 

$$;
Summary:. all i have to say is its about time microsoft did something right very stable havent had a problem yet "do yourselves a favor do a fresh install" dont like there activation policy but if you look real hard there is a way around it wink wink : ). 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using Windows XP Home for about a week and everything's worked fine. All my programs work, the home network that's connected to another WinME machine still works fine, and the OS is much faster and more stable; it hasn't crashed yet! There are only some minor issues with the OS. One, although I can understand that MS doesn't want it's software pirated as freely as previous versions I don't think people should have to buy a copy for every system. I'm a little annoyed about having to purchase a copy for every PC (I'm not by the way. I'm only putting XP on my main computer,) but that's what you agree to when you "sign" the EULA. Two, Microsoft did try to get me to get a .Net account but I simply just diabled it, I haven't seen it since. It's a big improvement over MS' previous home-oriented versions of Windows.. 

$$;
Summary:. Microsoft Windows XP is an extremely stable operating system by far, yes grunts going on I hear, and brings relief to me after years as a DOS user. I am just used to restarting my system three times just because my operating system had crashed, and a great excuse for not handing in your homework. However, since using Microsoft Windows XP, and that I was to speculate that it would be all froth, no substance scheme, I never had to restart my computer, even from the installation, on Thursday 25th October 2001, just over a week from now. New improved tools, like Disk Defragmentiser and Scandisk and yes, you can you can use third party tools as well. As for the operating system being faster, yes it is faster but only just and for the I am extremely impressed with this operating system and as for Windows Product Activation, it did not take me more then four minutes to activate my version of Microsoft Windows XP. Slight hitches, driver reinstallation and the Start menu not working, as I like. Just defragmentise your hard-drive after you have installed Microsoft Windows XP and all your applications, it will optimise your system by FAR.. 

$$;
Summary:. I installed XP on a ME machine and it completely loaded in less than 30 minutes. A freeze up problem that I had from day one with ME is gone and I could not be more satisfied with the upgrade. If you have no problems with your current OS then stick with it, but I have had glitches at all since the upgrade.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is by far the best version of windows to date. It's very stable but what attracts me most to it is the speed. XP boots in under 30 seconds, and it *never* slows down while in use. So if you're looking for a windows 2000 that's a good %300 faster, switch to XP.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is by far the best advance in OS's since Win95. If you run a home business, or bring home work to do on the family computer, then this is the operating system you've been dreaming of. Leave your work, or take a break from it and the whole family can log-on and do whatever. When you come back, log on back on to your profile and everything is just as you left it. This OS is also very easy to install. I transferred over 40 different programs from my WinME / Win 200O dual boot system and only one program didn't run was Norton's AV! Everything else loaded with ease. With my system booting up in less that 45 seconds... needless to say I'm very pleasantly suprised. The activation was a very simple process, the computer did everything for me, all I had to do was hit the "next" button. For those not willing or wanting to activate their copy, then I'm sure Microsoft just accomplished what they intended to do, drive away the bootleggers! Great OS! I love it!!. 

$$;
Summary:. There seem to be plenty of folks rating XP that are unable to be objective. This is a good product. The more I use XP, the more I like XP. I fail to see how Microsoft controls my computer as is suggested by some reviewers. Perhaps they do not have not spent enough time working with XP and were spewing premature opinions. Overall XP is an excellent improvement over past operating systems. It has the stability of Windows 2000, but is designed for the consumer. I found the GUI to be intuitive and "Help" to be very easy to use. XP is worth the expense. I am upgrading two desktops and one laptop to XP.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is stable and reliable to a point. some drivers not built for XP may cause problems... but the prodct works so well and gives you a choice of options.. incase it should crash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Runs stable and does not crash....yet. I had a dual boot with Win 98 for about a year, so I could run my scanner and printer and most of my software. I am getting pretty spoiled not having to mess with it so it won't crash.It's nice just to turn it on and. 
Cons:. I had to buy all new hardware and some new software.. 

$$;
Summary:. I thought it was going to wreak havoc on my '99 gateway win98, but it was pleasant and not too much fixing to do after the install. I have many programs and the old version of ms works which i don't use,(office pro is better),needs to reinstall. and a couple of other minor fixes and I was in business. Runs nicely.I am a happy man. 

$$;
Summary:. fundamentals are easy to grasp for the beginner, you can start working with XP almost straight-away, whereas you needed a college-degree in computing with 95 and 98.. 

$$;
Summary:. Being a PC Technician with approximately 20 years experience under my belt, I'll have to say I like WinXP overall. It is easier to install and it actually detects and installs hardware much better than Win98 or previous versions ever did. (Even Win2K) I like the overall look and feel and it is feature-packed for novices as well as advanced users. PROS: Ease of Install &#38; Use Look &#38; Feel Network Setup is easy and painless in most configs CONS: No driver support for my VideoHighwayExtreme TV/Video Capture Card. (Although the same problem with Win2K as well) I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars.. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded from WinME on my Dell 1.7Mhz P-4, 768 Rambus RAM, etc.. (plenty of power, new 5/1/02). Wait until you try this magic act. The upgrade interface is terrible. Not like going from 95 to 98SE or ME. Many drivers, less than a year old weren't compatible /w XP. Hardware wasn't either, though you get warnings only like: 'might' not be compatible, would you like to continue? Loss of data may result, etc. Try to get the Dell people to help. Nope, you have to deal w/ Microsoft on your own. The problem is: Microsoft, is jammed with support issues. Then, they tried to just refer me to general website articles, where you spend hours trying to figure out a solution that a human, if you could get one on the line, or live helpline could maybe do easier. When I tried to get to the live Microsoft helpline,,they wanted me to sign up for an additional 'fee', for such help. So unless you hang on the phoneline for an unknown amount of time to talk to someone, they want you to pay more $$ to get simple help. The best help from Microsoft that I got, was the advice to return the XP upgrade for a refund. Welcome back ME, unstable as it is, it is better than the XP Upgrade. Warning: You are on your own with your XP upgrade! And:Be sure you are a driver upgrade expert!. 

$$;
Summary:. The user switching feature makes it a must for families sharing one computer. The remote assistance feature allows "IT friendy people" to support users remotely.. 

$$;
Summary:. Seems Microsofts user interface is becoming more and more like Mac's. ie the little rubber ducky. However it seems more stable and a little quicker although I dont appriciate all the resources it uses. All in all I am glad I upgraded.. 

$$;
Summary:. Being primarily a unix and linux user. XP Home edition came with a new system I bought. At home I was still running Win95 dual booted with FreeBSD 4.4, windows was just used for gaming and some word processing, etc. I have work with Win98, NT, SBS and 2k pro at work over the years so I have worked with most Windows OS's. After working with XP for about a month (waiting for more hardware in the mail) I find the OS to be very stable like Win2000, more user friendly and appearing to be smarter.. I'm impressed! I have installed years of games and games demos and they have all worked! Quake3, Unreal Tournament, Alice, Giants, Need For Speed 3 (98), Quake 2 - gave errors on install like "Your cd drive is only 2x speed" although ran perfect. Let's see WSBK 2000 installed fine although error out on start up, I enabled compatibility mode for Win98 to the exe and it worked fine after. Let's see what else. Trouble installing scanner HP 5300C, XP crashed on start up. HP had released a patch I installed it and it's been working great. For anyone who is trying to decide if they should upgrade to XP, etc. I would! There are a lot of great features, etc. XP has over 98 and ME. Don't take the negative opinions from the broken back ME users! ME is one POS OS if I may say so.. 

$$;
Summary:. Best version of windows yet. Funny how all the negative reviewers XP mention os X. Co-incidence? I'm sick and tired of mac fans crowing on about how ms ripped off osx, when OS X features: 'The Dock'=windows taskbar. Web based folder views - windows had that years ago. Three button window controls. Its hardly one way traffic! In fact i would say OSX has become more like a windows machine than XP a mac.. 

$$;
Summary:. BUY THIS OS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING LESS THEN WINDOWS 2000 NO IF'S AND'S OR BUT'S JUST BUY IT! WILL IT FIX ALL YOUR PROBLEMS? MOST DEFFINATLY YES!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. to everybody still goin crazy with pc's fix the problem, get a mac, u will never be unhappy again. 

$$;
Summary:. No java support. No MP3 support. Registration/activation is a major pain and invasion of privacy. Limited # of installs. Looks hoaky too. Had to uninstall all software then reinstall and a lot still doesn't work.. 

$$;
Summary:. Is incredible the way Microsoft control the OS. Is even ridiculous, if my hard drive crashes I need to call Microsoft. No, no, no, no it wont work. Microsoft need to change that policy or die.. 

$$;
Summary:. Despite what many people may think, Windows XP is truly better than a lot of other operating systems. Sure it doesnt have many new features, but it does have that one feature it's called stability. Xp has the best stability seen in an OS (besides for Win2k). So many people complain about this operating system, well then I have three words for you "don't use it!". Throughout Reviews I've read I have noted some of the major complaints about the OS and I would like to respond to them. Ok Hardware and Software Compatibility; for the most part I have had no problem with these; besides most software and hardware has the drivers released for XP if they don't be patient they will the OS isn't even a week old yet. Product Activation...people complain about this; I have heard some stupid complaints concerning this. Oh it's such a long and tiring process...yeah right, right after I installed it I had the option to activate online it took less than one minute. I mean come one why complain about that big deal you have to register with them; then you shouldn't have bought the OS you knew about it. Now the real major issue I've seen Microsoft controlling your computer that is the stupidest thing I've heard, does Microsoft actually turn your computer on in the middle of the night...no, some people need to grow up and live the fact that the OS is designed to make life easier for the user. Some things may annoy you about the OS..if they do then once again don't get the Operating System. Did you ever read the EULA? It has stated since the beginning that the OS is not supposed to be distributed on more than one computer...so stop whining about that. It's been there now Microsoft has a way to enforce it now. Has Microsoft copied off Apple? Not really in my opinion. Wow they have the same features....it's called competition...it's how you make money. So as you can see many people complain about many things in my opinion this is well worth an upgrade if you have Me or 98 because it is way more stable....if you have Win2k that's your call, you may actually like Win2k better, but I don't. I think this OS is well worth the money and I'm very happy with this OS. I upgraded from Win Me with no problems installation took about 60 minutes; runs great on a 600mhz machine with 256 megs of ram.. 

$$;
Summary:. While allot of the new features are nice. I have still managed to crash my system 3 times today doing the most mundane tasks. Wait for the 1st Service Pack if you can.. 

$$;
Summary:. Like many people, I have several computers networked at home. I can't affort to pay for several copies of XP! I'll stick with Win-ME, no complaints there.. 

$$;
Summary:. I will not buy it. I will find another operating system. I will not but 3 copies for my two laptops and one desktop at home!. 

$$;
Summary:. I have read many complaints about microsofts latest operating system, most of which i think are unfounded. One the gui- personally I like it, the new interface is very nice. But if you don't like it you can put it back to the way win 98 looks like. Two- Driver Updates This is a bit annoying, sometimes you must hunt down your drivers. However most companies posted the latest xp drivers on their websites, now how hard can that be? Furthermore, the driver updates are for your benefit- they add to the stability of the system. Three- Stability. Back up ur files, find those old software cds and Do a clean install, trust me, the system will be much better. Xp has a different architecture than me, 98, 95, it was built on NT/2000 technology, much better, much more stable. Four- New Features Xp recoginized all of my hardware except 1, xp has its own cd-burning utility for quick burns, xp has user accounts for multiple users (great for families), Networking support is great, i set up my network in 10 minutes with xp. Remote Support is also a great feature, especially if you have broadband. I have helped many a friend with computer probs through it. Five- Min System Requirements I have a 366mhz celeron processor with 128mbs ram on a 4 year old gateway. Xp has made my dinosaur of a computer run much faster, and it has not crashed in months! (If your wondering I didn't actually buy windows xp, thank u Kazaa) All in all if done right windows xp is a great upgrade, especially from win me, that horrible excuse for an os..

Summary:. First of all I work in the MIS department of a pretty big company(you would know it if I told you the name) where we use Windows 2000. Up until recently I've been using Windows Me at home, mostly becuase I didn't want to pay for 2000. I like a lot of the features of 2000, and while Me worked just fine on my P4 1.8ghz pc with 512MB of ram, I wanted more of the security and multiple user options that are found in XP. I tried Windows XP home, and it's not bad. Sure it doesn't have all the features of XP Pro, but I didn't want to shell out the extra bucks for the pro version. I like the way it keeps great logs of any program errors, and the task manager and the login and logoff settings. I think this is best for the regular home user. It's even better if your computer is shared between family members. Multiple user settings, the ability to have users without giving them administrator priveleges is great. The bottomline, worth the upgrade from Windows 95,98, or ME, if your computer can handle it. If you can afford it and know a little more about computers then the average joe, go for the pro version. P.S. Don't pirate your copy cuz if Microsoft finds more people trying to register the product number you paid for, then your gonna be out of luck when they deactivate your registration..

Summary:. Some of my programs that are only 1 year old won't work. I can't get it to boot fast and shut down takes forever. Try getting help from Dell. I have called repeatedly and all I get is "why do you want to do that?" I can't find out what to do so it will run faster. It's a new 8200 pent4 with 518 rd ram. It's really slow and Dell people say it's normal because XP is such a big program. I have another Dell 350 Pent 2/384 ram, that's about 4 years old and it's almost as fast as the "wonderful XP"! The only help I really got with anything was from a guy at Lexmark.Go Figure!. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded from ME on a p3 with 758 megs ram, two 8-gig HDDS. XP wanted a 1.2 GIG swap file; I use the machine for photoshop, which eats swap space in a hurry. Photoshop would hang when working with large files (same files, same situations on ME did not) and I would lose any unsaved work. Switching PShop and XP's swap files between the drives the didn't help. The worst part was the XP drivers for my printers and scanners didn't allow full dpi printing. On the EPSON 1280 you can only go 1440 (yeah, I know, that's all you need blah-blah, NO IT ISN'T) and the win2k drivers from epson didn't always work with the 1280 or the 1200. If you're into serious photoshopping get a mac. I got my first one two weeks ago. G4 dual and it blows the XP config away. But, like I said, XP for Office apps and home networking, gaming, ripping, is fine. Serious design, nope.. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded to Windows XP when I got my new PC and everything went smoothly. Except then I wanted to play some games and use my voodoo2 and guess what? The windows 2000 base doesn't support the voodoo 2 or games like Grand Theft Auto 2 or The Sims Livin Large.. 

$$;
Summary:. My system: Home built; Asus A7A266A motherboard, Athlon T-Bird 1.4GHz, Radeon VE 32MB, 128MB DDR memory, Creative 4224E CD-RW, NEC 16X DVD. First of all, let me say this: XP is a lot better than Windows 98SE trying to run on my new system. I had all sorts of problems with 98 on my system. XP seems to have taken care of all of it. I've never used Windows NT or 2000 so I have no idea of the advances compared there. So far I see that it isn't very different from Windows 98 in it's exterior. People say it's Windows 2000 on the interior. A few cool new features caught my eye coming from 98. It's stable as a rock, unless you install something it doesn't like. Then it's blue screen hell whenever you start your computer up. It's only happened to me once though and I had to reinstall the OS. No biggy. I'm only testing it out now before I get serious with it. So I'm still doing work on my trusty old Power Macintosh 6100/66/G3240MHz with Mac OS 9.0.4. What I'd like to see is support for my Creative 4224E CD-RW drive. It's seen as a regular CD-ROM. I've tried contacting Creative and Microsoft about it, but they haven't responded on that subject. I hope an update comes out that fixes that. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're using Windows 98SE on a really new computer then you'd probably do better upgrading to XP. If you're using Windows 2000, then don't bother and stick with 2000. Compatability is good with software I have. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 can only work on XP with Windows 98/ME compatability mode on. But that's ok. It's like setting the Prefered Size in the memory panel in a Get Info window in Mac OS. If your software is acting wonky, then see if Compatability Mode can help. It's located in the Properties window of the app under the Compatability tab. This can be reached through the app's (executable's) shortcut too. Support is lacking in some of the key areas I talked about. Stability was only an issue that one time and sometimes with Windows Media Player when playing some DVDs. Features tend to be par for the course with Windows 98SE, but they're helpful and some additions are welcome (like filmstrip viewing of directories (folders)). Quality is your Windows average with some ease of use features added Mac-style.. 

$$;
Summary:. Pros: far more stable very user-friendly. perhaps - too much so. the interface is very customizable. some very useful newly integrated features, eliminating some of the need to have many small programs installed. Cons: too many "helpful warnings" and support options popping up still needs patches as often as older operating systems - one patch was available upon the day of release. some advanced features become buried by the new idiot-proof interface... I found it a pain in the neck when networking became involved. Overall I like it, but an upgrade doesn't seem worthwhile if your computer isn't a late model.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have had xp for 3 days now and so far I like it. Even though you do have to get xp drivers for every device.. 

$$;
Summary:. Unlike Matthew,I have had some problems with XP. First off I couldn't overclock my hardware, this is what causes stability to go. Then I had to fight Xp to use the nvidia drivers. And to top it off the Luna got deleted. The new features are great they help alot. I say update if you only need too. Windows Xp is ok but it could be alot better.. 

$$;
Summary:. After years of enduring the Win9x line, this is the best Bill&#38;Co could come up with!? Thank god its stable, but so is my 2000 machine at work. Now I feel that MicroSoft is forcing me to go their way more than ever.. 

$$;
Summary:. MS is so UN-Original. Using windows based machines over the years has me really sick and tired of these half-a$$ed copys of other os's (not going to name names but it starts with Mac). The only thing windows has going for it is low cost computers for drones like me. But if you want class and "BMW" like experience.. Go Apple. We have both OS's running at home and now I tend to preffer apple.. Although I rely on my PC for work.. 

$$;
Summary:. After using it for a good half hour at my local computer store, I found out that XP isn't all that it's cracked up to be. To start off with, it's extremely slow. This is on a brand new Pentium IV computer. Window resizing is jerky (even on Classic UI mode), and dragging windows is laggy. The UI is terrible. All the colours clash, and it is very distracting. Everything on the OS is MS this, MS that... .NET at least doesn't take over your computer as much as you may expect, and Windows Messenger is quite good. If your on Windows 9.x, I suggest you upgrade. The stability enhancements itself is worth the upgrade, but you'll probably need new hardware, this OS is so demanding. Win2K users, don't bother. Nothing new. Overall, on the 'other side' Mac OS X is really starting to look good. It's UI is incredible and performance/stability wise excellent. Third party support is quite good, as new commercial apps are getting released everyday (And Office is due later this month). If you're doing any serious work, and you feel that not upgrading to XP will leave you behind, switch to X.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have been running XP since RC1 and love it. Have almost all of my apps/hardware with the exception of Pinnacle Systems DV500+ (due to lack of drivers from Pinnacle) working with no problems. BTW using WinXP Professional!. 

$$;
Summary:. This is the best OS from Microsoft ever..Very cool, fast for my Athlon 1.4 gig..however, comparing head to head with my iBook running Mac OSX.1, i would prefer OSX.1 to be my daily OS...but if you are a PC only user, i would strongly suggest you to upgrade! it's worth it. (or try out the OSX.1 for Mac, you won't be disappointed). 

$$;
Summary:. the only reason for the activation, and one computer for one disc, i can think of is microsoft's vendetta against the anti-trust suit. its always nice to know that we the consumers are caught up in it. personally i think it will be microsoft that pays in the end, this just gives more fuel to the fire, this case the fire being the anti-trust law suit.. 

$$;
Summary:. Microsoft has always included many great features with their new OS. But their are always a coupple of kinks still to be worked out.. 

$$;
Summary:. Wow i just compared osx 10.1 to xp and as shooked i was xp was cheapper 97 to 105 compared to 120 to 125. You to can do this if you dont belive me. and those who say heftly requariments there the same as os x. what are you talking about. 1.5gb same as os x. 128mb of ram sam as osx. actualy you can get by witn 64 or even less then 300 mghz with newer system. and What computer now doesnt have more then 300mghz for god shake give me a break the oldest comptuer in my house has 600mghz. Basicly people have been saying negtive reviews about windowes not on facts just pure resentment of upgradeing. Which i think everyone will. Dont get me wrong i hate microsoft and rather use a mac os. But my sony vaio doesnt have that and xp looks pretty cool to me. So the bodem line is the choice is yours they got the same review score and they both have many of the same features, plus hey its microsoft not always the best os but this time it is as cnet said a worth whille upgrde.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is stable. I liked that bit! The only good thing! So far I have only crashed it once (I am a heavy user) when normally (especially in Win98 crap!) it would crash every 5 minutes.. 
Cons:. If it does crash or a program goes down it never recovers until reboot. WHY!? Macs do, if a program goes in Mac you just restart the program (NOT THE PC!) and it runs fine, it's like Microsoft don't know what to do with the RAM if a program crashes. Secur. 

$$;
Summary:. New Dell Inspiron w/ME in Oct, with free XP upgrade. Bad move to upgrade!! Three of my most used programs, CD Creator (&lt;5) and Camedia 2.0(Olympus digital camera) required upgrades ($70 and $40) because previous versions were not supported by the manufacturers for XP. The DoD version of Norton AV doesn't work either! Had to buy new (although Dell did include NAV 2002)! Several other programs were basically SOL, though. And after a week on non use, it hung on every program I tried to run. I flushed it, did the ZZ Top restore, and am sticking with ME.. 

$$;
Summary:. Some softwares may not run right on XP, but also some hardwares! The best windows for home use I used was Windows ME so if you have Windows ME, I recommend you stick with it. O yeah I think XP GUI looks like something for 5 year olds.. 

$$;
Summary:. Looking for drivers for scanner-webcam-digicam-printer.Not all were found and Norton 2000 is also not supported.I'm sure more suprises are in store for me.I wish I had known! It came on an Emachine(ok)w/almost no extra software from CompUSA.To top it all off it had no pre installed anti virus protection.I'm going to partition and go back to W/98.. 

$$;
Summary:. When I bought my New Pc. It came with Windows XP in it. I was like I hear this OS sucked blah blah blah. I get the pc and stuff outta the box. Hooked up. And im like Ya I can deal witht his. After awhile the GUI was getting annoying! But theres a couple things in this Os i really like. Like how easy it is to Create a Cd, Setting up a Network, and How fast it boots up. Now what I didn't like are the Open Holes that allows people to try and access the pc. The lag that some video games are and that gay looking GUI(Graphical User Interface). I give this a 4 out of 10. 

$$;
Summary:. I love Macs, I love them for many reasons and I will never buy a windows machine... However, after previewing XP, I've decided that it is definately a step in the right direction for Microsofts OS. If I were a PC user, I would definately give it a try, although support for the new OS to my opinion is barely acceptable. But, that's not to say that XP will never receive the support it needs, it will... but for now, if you're looking for something new, and are definately into Wintel machines, I see no harm in the upgrade. I want to give PC users a middle ground here... I give it a thumbs up.. 

$$;
Summary:. Microsoft expects to fall for the fancy graphics and cute little help wizards to forget what they are really trying to cover. As a developer and a user of Linux and Win9X OS, I find WinXP very annoying. Not only is most of my software incompatible, but it takes even longer to boot up now.. 

$$;
Summary:. After reading the glowing reviews for the XP operating system, I fully expected that my Dell Dimension XPS T__ 700 MHz Pentium 3 with 256K RAM purchased in May 2000 would work well with XP. It was a state-of-the-art machine at the time of purchase. I was aware that certain software was incompatible (e.g. Norton Utilities and Norton anti-virus) which had to be upgraded. However, after I opened the XP box I started reading the compatibility info which utimately led me to the Dell Website that gave me this startling news: "While this Dell system may comply with Microsoft hardware requirements it may not provide the best customer experience with Windows XP, as its BIOS &#38; drivers will not support Windows XP to Dell's testing standards. Dell will not be creating another BIOS or drivers to support this operating system. If you are interested in running Windows XP, Dell recommends that you upgrade to a new system designed for performance and compatibility with the Windows XP operating system." In other words, I just wasted $99.00 unless I want to ante up for a new computer. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. It SOUNDS good, offer a lot of promises. But when you finally evaluate what you've got and "how much you paid (for it and all the new softwares and hardwares)", "how much time you spent on it" and "how much risk you are taking by getting this mixedly reviewed product", you will be better off to hold your thought, either wait till patches come or wait till you buy a new system with it pre-installed. If your OS ain't broke, why fix it?. 

$$;
Summary:. I'm getting tired of constant updates for this horrid operating system. This is simply getting too expensive. The only benefit to xp is that is doesn't suck as much as the previous version. I have 2000 on one of my systems. If you have that stick with it, it's just as stable, faster, and doesn't look like a fisher price interface. I only wish I could afford a Mac or figure out a Linux box.. 

$$;
Summary:. Well, the Interface is just painted on. The new start button takes up 50% more of the start bar, and the start menu takes up most of the screen by default. The Luna theme stinks of half heartedness, and the poor classic theme isn't complete if you ask me.. 

$$;
Summary:. No bis step into the future but some cosmetics for an OS that is already outdated today!. 

$$;
Summary:. First of all I am glad that Microsoft finally gives home-users an operating system running on the NT kernel which means that it won't crash as much as the totally useless versions of win9x does (and that includes winme). However, as a pro, and as a testuser of XP since rc1, I have to say that XP gives me about zero advantages over win2k. I just find myself playing around in XP for some hours, then returning to Win2k. Why? Because XP's GUI Luna is a horrible interface which is just a bad copy of Apple's Aqua and the "great new features" are really just dumb-downed features which you'll also find in win2k. I hate all the wizards and help-things that pop up everywhere! Also, I am scared about how Microsoft wants to control their software with their new licencing policy, and I'm just not "going there". Thank good I have my iBook with MacOS X..... 

$$;
Summary:. After using it for a while, I decided to downgrade to Win2000. I just feel 'bloated' when using it. The window and everything look like they're copied from MacOS X?. 

$$;
Summary:. Do not buy this thing. Microsoft has gone too far with the Big Brother Stuff, they have no business knowing what's inside your computer, no matter how neat their operating system is. I have an MCP, MCSE, Linux (all the flavors), A+, Hubble certifications. I like Apple too, doesn't crash at all from my experience. What troubles me is people keep buying this stuff and it's not an original O/S nor a good one at that, it's a conglomerate of other O/Ss. I do not recommend this system, too intrusive, too media friendly, they do not educate you in Computer operations nor their O/S (Follow Microsoft's lead mentality).. 

$$;
Summary:. I'm returning it asap. First off, the installer crashed, then it wanted to tell Microsoft I bought it! Hell No! I went back to my 98se (I'll live with the crashes).. 

$$;
Summary:. As the lemmings move to embrace the newest offering from Microsoft, (which in fact has many new and improved features)... they must be unaware of the looming control Microsoft intends to grab, over their minds and pocket-books. Not a good upgrade for people wanting choice and freedom.. 

$$;
Summary:. Without serious hardware upgrades (think multi-processors) don't even think of trying it!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. big dissappont... Only change appearance don't make people happy. Why? They cannot invent new technology their own? Interface is even came from Mac's Icon company, Iconfactory... Shame on Window user. Many of my friend who think only Window is world No.1 OS... well, What I want to say is very shame.... 

$$;
Summary:. I m going to keep winMe. First of all, the computer I bought in december 2000 is not XPcompatibel. 2nd, There are not enough new features to pay $99 for! Third, MS stinx.. 

$$;
Summary:. It's a great OS if you want Microsoft to know what time you eat dinner and how you @#$% your wife.. 

$$;
Summary:. I've taken some time to look over XP. From a security standpoint for a home or small business user, BAD, very bad. XP in it's default state can be exploited by hackers and virus alike. Now if you are in the know of the open sockets and are willing to custom install every machine on your network, you might want to implement it some time in the future when it matures. It seems stabile. My problem is backwards compatability, something that the Mac users griped about with the change to OS 10 (which at least could emulate classic for older apps). Microsoft seems to think the average user has a ten year old reading level with the overall look and feel of the OS (i switched back to classic in a heartbeat (the less graphics, the better). I rate XP about where I rate CE sorry to say. hardwarre compatability is there but personally I don't want every flippin' driver on my machine. Linux (Mandrake 8.1) wins in this reguard. A considerable thumbs up goes to Apple for 10.1, you keep building that up Jobs, and Wintel users are going to scream for it. Microsoft needs to put their increased marketshare attitude in check and start thinking of a better, unix based OS the catch up to everyone else. I feel it's days are numbered, it's just too big of a hog. Please don't tell me you really are trying to shove in your own internet protocol.... 

$$;
Summary:. I don't get it.. While I install I saw most fastest Windog yet but it's actually slower.. why??. 

$$;
Summary:. Better than ME??? Win 3.1 is better than ME Stick with 2k !. 

$$;
Summary:. The ratings are for Quality, Features, stability and support. Why? I mean, you can have a very good quality product with lots of nice features that is stable. Does that make a great product? I think it takes more than that. What about value? As a Windows2000 user I see more features and new GUI on this release, however there are also too many wizards getting in the way trying to automate every silly process. Its the first OS that is actually annoying me. I am using RC2, and I have ordered the new release, however I am considering canceling the order. It seems as if Microsoft got rid of functionality for a pretty look. The plumbing is still there, but getting to it appears to take an extra step or two. Setting are buried in places that are not intuitive and forces me to hunt for functions I know exist. What about people who dont know or expect them to be there? I had hopes for XP, but I am afraid I find Windows2000 to be the better OS.. 

$$;
Summary:. Oh my. Did they take out all software related to other vendors? Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft.. all over the OS. And when you escape their shameless promo's it's time for the hardware vendor (in my case HP) to do their damage. I can no longer connect to my Novell network because they REMOVED the client which was in every OS from Win95-ME. No thanks.. 

$$;
Summary:. I personally hate it but it's what I used to learn about PCs. It doesn't let you do the stuff pros would like to do but it is the leading OS and comes with most PCs.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is cool, although it's not as "crash proof" as they claim. After installing Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks, mine hard crashes anytime I attempt to synch. my pocket PC. If I insert the PPC in the cradle my PC reboots. Other than that, it's OK. I didn't particularly want to upgrade, but MS has left ME users in the cold. Movie Maker 2 has capture capability, (something I prefer for my dv camera). Unfortunately, Movie Maker 2, as well as most MS add-ons, is now only available for XP. I upgraded because MS has basically stopped supporting ME for everything except the most basic of updates. Anyway, a more curious question is: Why does MS package XP in a cheap cardboard foldout, yet packages inexpensive, useless garbage like Plus! in a nice transport-friendly DVD case?. 

$$;
Summary:. I've contacted MSoft for a refund, keep your fingers crossed for me. My Canon Printer and my Olympus slide scanner no longer work. Even basic apps like Norton Systemworks 2002 no longer work. Takes forever to do things I did very simply under Windows 98. I don't really understand where MS is headed with this product. I use Win2000 a work easily, I see no interface commonalities with that product.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is Microsoft earning some extra money on Win2k while waiting for the next thing. Win2k has internal version 5.0 and XP has internal version 5.1 I think that speaks for itself.. 

$$;
Summary:. Using some Motorola development system interface software. Works on '98, crashes on XP. XP not good with paths on non-MS applications. Very shaky!. 

$$;
Summary:. My compaq presario 5100an 900mhz duron came with an upgrade to XP voucher from the preinstalled ME. When it arrived in the post i done clean reinstall of ME and upgraded to XP to find my gforce2 mx400{supplied by compaq}had major compatibility problems with zbuffer and alternate buffer depth not even showing up in the cards properties and crimson skies{a microsoft game} crashing due to it being unable to draw the graphics properly and then getting stuck in a constant loop followed by a restart and error report be sent to MS,hohum.I have tried all driver and bios updates and redetecting my video card. Also my floppy driver whirrs and revs so much it sounds like its going to fly out of the tower when shutting down and rebooting.It could be something to do with the IRQ steering or numbers but i don't know enough about that side of it,{yet}. So until I get some positive answers from MS or compaq I've reinstalled ME as my graphics are great and my floppy doesn't sound like it's trying to kill itself{i mean major over reving}.Also current wingman software needed to be updated with a big download from logitech,{thank god it was there}.. 

$$;
Summary:. Media Player does a mediocre job with audio even at the 192 bitrate. The CD burn function is next to impossible to work with. If you change your mind about a file you'll have to log out and back in before you can delete it from the drive's list. I've tried using it for three months now with little success. It converts audio files to MS media files and then converts them back and usually not very well. The Windows picture and fax viewer set itself to the default viewer for every image it can view even though I've tried to have the system use Vueprint which I feel is probably the best all-around viewer available. Don't try to use the restore function for anything more than going back to just before something went wrong...I went back three weeks and lost everything. Apparently the help function, the cd-rom, the DVD, and restore all use scripts from IE and when that goes you're left with squat. I should have opted for Win 2000 pro instead of XP pro. XP doesn't seem to be anthing more than Win2000 with the screwed up Win ME GUI. I bought a new P4 system with everything on it in November and I'm half afraid to us it for anything important for fear of losing it all again.. 

$$;
Summary:. Some games that say are compatible for windows XP arn't really cause OPENGL isn't compatible with XP. I'm really anoyed and dissapointed.. 

$$;
Summary:. I installed XP and three days later, after many error msgs, my HHD crashed! I can't say that XP was the problem, but it sure is a coincidence. The only two feature I like about XP is the digital photo uploading speed from my camera and and fax program. The rest sucks!. 

$$;
Summary:. Yes. That's about all you get. Colors. Maybe if you're in pre-school, the colors will appeal to you. As will the nifty help wizards that dog your every step. It's like having an annoying friend who won't leave your house and keeps eating all your food!. 

$$;
Summary:. My opinion of XP can be summed up with one observation: I hate wizards. These things constantly pop up trying to tell me what I want to do. Instead of making an OS that empowers the user to do tasks, like a good tool does, Microsoft has made an OS that tries to second guess the user and do everything for them. In comparison, Mac OS X dispenses with the wizards and makes even complicated tasks easy by giving the user the proper GUI tools to do the job. Stability is finally good, compared to other windows systems XP is a rock. But as Windows has finally become stable, so has the Mac OS with OS X. In fact in my experience OS X is more stable than XP, but it could be the hardware I'm running XP on. Speaking of OS X, there's Aqua, it's beautiful GUI, and then there's Luna, a cheap rip-off of Aqua. Why can't Microsoft make their own original GUI? Why must they rip off Apple? Unfortunately MS did not rip off Apple's lack of a verification system for the OS. XP's authentication system is a desperate attempt to rake in more money, and this is one user who refuses to put up with such nonsense. I pay for my software, and I resent being treated like some 15 year old Hotline-Haxxor. (support gets a 1/5 for the verification scheme). I'll be using OS X full time, and if I need windows, then virtual PC for OS X works in a pinch.. 

$$;
Summary:. Just when I thought microsoft was doing something right, they come up with another frickin' MacOS clone. Maybe someday they will live up to their claim of being "innovative," but not today.. 

$$;
Summary:. I hate the name "XP". Why they decided to use the charactor "X" as the Apple already released the Mac OS "X".. 

$$;
Summary:. I was in Sam's Club and saw a Compaq computer with XP. I was curious to try it out. I noticed it didn't have any icons on the desktop. I though someone had deleted them. Later found out it came like that. That's odd. I went to play some *.wav files to hear what it was like. Then it said "You don't have sufficient privileges to play this file." You need special privileges to play a wav file? That's silly. I've been using SuSE linux for a year now and it all works just fine. I will also get the New iMac with its OS X 10.2 Jaguar since it is UNIX based. MS needs to get with UNIX also.. 

$$;
Summary:. I recently bought a new computer with Windows XP and I hate it. I thought I just needed to get used to it, but I'm still not. WinXP Home Edition doesn't support my scanner (I heard that Professional Edition does support it, can we say "messed up"?!), which isn't that old and a HP, you'd think it would work properly. It doesn't support my webcam either. I now have to order new drivers for my scanner, which is gonna cost me time and money, since they have to be imported from a foreign friggin' country. All the advanced options are hidden within menu within menu within....oh yes, menu. I definitely miss Windows '98, which is crazy, because that one wasn't that stable either. It may look pretty and colorful, but don't upgrade. Just a little tip from a regular user from Holland.. 

$$;
Summary:. If I had my choice for my system after having spent the money for this "upgrade" I would have to go with Win 95. So far its the only OS that was and is stable. Why can't Windows build on that? Sometimes Windows fans like stability, performance, and dependability...not pretty colors, crashes, and incompatibility issues. And support....ha ha ha. Microsoft support will cost you as much as the OS itself. So much for that.. 

$$;
Summary:. The ONLY thing that is good about this OS is the stability. Other then that, run far, far away.. 

$$;
Summary:. Buy XP if you want to spend your time at microsoft update page every day. There's nothing better than wasting half your time on-line downloading patches!! Great job Bill, you really pulled one over me!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I thought XP was to stand for experience. This is the lowest grade of Windows to come out yet, once you get behind the cute interface. I would prefer 3.11 over this. I haven't purchased it yet, but I have set up computers with it, and it only causes headaches..

Summary:. Software problems GALORE with almost everything in the mainstream market that nobody is even sure how to fix! Have to install new drivers, sometimes reinstall hardware. Just a mess! Don't plan on using Win XP unless you have at least a week of time to waste trying to get the thing running and a really nice computer geek for a friend..

Summary:. Nobody "twisted my arm" to buy this lame OS, it came installed on my Dell 8200 P4 system. My frustrations are the same - instability,wizards, crashes while playing games and a GUI that resembles AOL's cartoon-like interface. It gets old having to reset dial-up connection and preference settings each time XP decides to change them on it's own. Why can't I run certain tasks without a fricken password ??? (defrag, disk clean up, etc.).Where is scandisk, real player and java support ? There are about 3/4 good features; quick start up and shut down, quick defrag, and DLL compatibility support. Unless you like spending time hunting down drivers and patches and wondering if maybe YOU did something wrong to screw up your computer, stick with 98/98-2nd/2000/ME. Funny though, try finding one of these OS verions on the shelves lately. ��.

Summary:. I ordered a new Dell 8200 with the XP Home Edition and it worked great for the first week. I then started getting blue screen crashes and serious windows errors. I have been trying to find a solution for the last two months, but it looks like format time! After reading many XP reviews, it seems either you are lucky or VERY unlucky if you happen to install software that XP doesn't like. If I had any idea of what I was getting into, I would have had Windows 2000 Pro installed on the PC, which has been very stable on my work computer. Even though software and hardware is rated as XP compatible, don't always believe it!. 

$$;
Summary:. Your statement," You will not loose any of your program information." Half way through the installition you start it all over again and then make the remark on a drop down," We are reformating your hard drive." You did and I still don't have my programs back as your criticle update on 01/18/02 wiped out my printer, Iomega drive programs,Lotus Suite,Quicken 2002 Delux sections and others. I had to unstall my Norton programs, repurchase new ones. Compatility-" If it worked on your old Windows Program (Win 98 SE) it will work here. You are getting a lot of good word-of-mouth advertising on this program. I'm getting mad again. Willie Jackson. 

$$;
Summary:. I found it's performance, features, and stability lacking. It loses modem settings and CD drives where I would have to make a new dial-up connection every week and reboot every 8 hours to reset the CD drives. Creating videos is a bad expirence. I can copy video at 320x240 at 30 fps with Windows 98 and Linux but I'm lucky if I get 12 fps with XP no matter how much I overdrive the CPU. Printing is only half as fast with XP compared to 98, DVD's won't play with the software that I've got and I was insulted to have to pay $50 for CD recording software that I had with 98 for free with the recorder. (XP's built in CD-RW support is a joke - CD's won't work on other machines.) XP's built in firewall is also a joke. I can download better firewalls for nothing. XP still goes completely unresponsive after running for a while or may spontaneously reboot without warning. The eye candy interface appears to have come from either Matell or Fisher-Price or some dumb thing. I hate all those stupid pop-up balloons that pop up everytime I connect or do something and I really hate all those rediculous wizards that insist on knowing what I want to do when it doesn't. One more point I'd like to make. I think it's interesting how people continue the rediculous irrelevant sorry debate of Microsoft vs. Apple. God, who gives a $h!+? Those two nit wits together couldn't come up with anything even close to a Unix distribution. So the debate is nothing but a load of useless propaganda. You wan't something that will not let you down when you need it the most? Either build your own GNU/Linux distribution, or get one of the BSDs. That's a fact!. 

$$;
Summary:. XP Home OR Pro is a joke. Take my (and so many other peoples) advice and buy Win2k. But if you want a buncha pretty colors and funny sounds, and a perfect rip of Win2k, then I guess XP is for you. =]. 

$$;
Summary:. An attempt at copying Apple's OSX. Home users should just get a mac for it's ease of use and clean graphics.. 

$$;
Summary:. It is obvious that Microsoft thinks they can do things better than Companies who specialize in specific areas. You will find that the excellant features on these outside firms are not compatable with XP. I found that XP crashes a lot using my Compaq laptop where it ran great with Windows ME. 

$$;
Summary:. The system seems to offer nothing over my previous win98. Except now alot of software doesn't work, I get serious crashes every day and my cd burners won't work.. 

$$;
Summary:. Give me a break. New and improved? Yeah right!! :-D This is simply Windows 2000 with a tumor. The extra colors and graphics are just about the only difference, except for the fact that XP's new kernel 5.1 supports less than Windows 2000. What happens when you remove all the cute colors? You're right back at Windows 2000 with less compatibility!! If you're using Windows 2000, do NOT, I repeat do NOT convert to XP. The worse upgrade M$ has to offer as of yet. (I'm not even going to list all the times it has crashed on it's OWN and integrated programs.). 

$$;
Summary:. two words XP sucks. HERE is a simple list of pros and cons!! PROS: -good looking (who cares) -more functions then ME -thats about it!!! CONS -internet explorer is barely capable and its the same company -SLOW AS HELL -SLOW AS HELL -ANNOYING TO MANY THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU BUT DONT. 

$$;
Summary:. Tried it and didn't like it. I cannot see buying this so called innovated new operating system when it is nothing but a jazzed up Windows ME. I just cannot justify coughing up another $99.00 or $199.00 when they both do not satisfy your computing needs any better than Windows ME and 2000. Both XPs also have a lack of hardware and software support. That is a crying shame Microsoft.. 

$$;
Summary:. Software to load scanner and camera are not compatable wqith X.P. Cannot find scanner or Digital Camera. Many prograns appeart loaded but when opened you are prompted to buy them.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is built on the solid Win2000 core, but manages to crash more often. Additionally, MS has built in restrictions to peripherals and drivers, and crippled the ability to fully customize network options. This upgrade is not worth the trouble.. 

$$;
Summary:. Same old, same old. MS comes up with an OS with more copied features, an ugly and non-intuitive interface and an annoying activation feature. Nevermind that you can't rip mp3s without paying extra (on top of the ridiculous price) or that eventually MS will have you pay a fee every month to use their products. XP? EW!!. 

$$;
Summary:. This is no revolution in computing... Get a real computin platform that was built for the system its running on: Mac OS X. 

$$;
Summary:. Didn't like the Fisher Price look. Didn't like all the wizards. Most of all, didn't like the fact that I have to pay to encode MP3s.. 

$$;
Summary:. This OS is just like MacIntosh's there is no use for upgrading. Also, Microsoft has gotten even greedier ever since the court case: Microsoft is now using Product Activation as a excuse for getting money - they never did that for the other Oses (which were before the case), why now (after the case)? Overall, those flying people in those XP commercials should be grounded (you know, that stupid XP commercial where business people are flying around handing papers to each other [one more thing, that is not funny; it has nothing to do with wireless networking]).. 

$$;
Summary:. Considerably slower than previous versions. Not nearly as stable as 2000 and definitely poorly designed when compared to 2000. Don't upgrade !!.
