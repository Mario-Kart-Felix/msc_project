$$;

Cons:. none, the monitor can be bigger.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ordered monitor on Friday, received it on Monday. Came neatly packaged and with Analog and digital cables (a 50 dollar value). Looks beautiful, the monitor and the display. The monitor is very nicely designed and the height adjuster and swirl functions. 

$$;
Pros:. there is no way you can beat 525 for a 19 inch 25ms lcd monitor. in fact, it's a better deal than many 18's and some 17 inch lcd's. zero bad pixels. very bright and a good neutral white rather than the reddish tint of the samsung 191t (dell 1900fp) i had. 
Cons:. nothing. 

$$;
Pros:. 19" display, USB 2.0, metal stand base, study neck stand, THIN bezzel making duel monitors even better! Dont let the .294 fool you. I just went to this from a .20 CRT, barely a differance once you go DVI. 
Cons:. Umm...I had to club a baby seal to in order to purchase this thing of beauty. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive (I paid only 554.90+s/h), but full of features. The design is simple and clean. The 5 USB ports are easily accessable and very handy for digital cameras, MP3 players, etc. The color was as good as my CRT. I also like the hight adjustable s. 
Cons:. The resolution could be better. I experienced some "bleeding" of text where the text "bled" into other pixels...especially with smaller fonts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very clean crisp display. Even as I increased the refresh rate and increased the resolution.. 
Cons:. 2 USB ports on left side of screen did not come configured out of the box. I guess they need some updated driver.. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor is really good for the regular user looking for a 19" lcd. It has crisp images and is nice and bright.. 
Cons:. if you're a FPS gamer, keep looking or wait for the Dell 2001fp. The FPS games on the 1901 are way to blurry and I experienced lots of ghosting. The games I currently play are BF 1942, Call of Duty and Tiger Woods 2004. While Tiger Woods was acceptable, t. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome pic quality, small form factor, nice design, only $540! This monitor's a winner. 
Cons:. Wish it had smaller resolution. max is 1240x1024, which is acceptable but i wish font size could be smaller than 96 dpi. i have 17" ultrasharp lcd and that 1 has very small fonts so at teh end these 2 monitors seem to have the same real estate space??. 

$$;
Pros:. Great clarity. Adjustable stand is very useful. 4 - 2.0 USB ports place in well-designed areas.. 
Cons:. None.

Pros:. This is an incredible monitor. It has everything the average user would need, and frankly I can't imagine anyone needing more. It is very bright, very clear, and the color is excellent. Also, the display is consistent from the top to the bottom in rend. 
Cons:. It took three days to get here?. 

$$;
Pros:. I hesitated in buying the monitor without being able to see it and almost got a Samsung from a local store. I am glad I didn't. Dell don't tell you enough about the great features of this monitor in terms of adjustability - I didn't see any others with. 

$$;
Pros:. if you want a fp monitor, this is the one. Big, bright and beautiful picture. I have a DVI connection and havent noticed a problem with ghosting. The resolution beats the heck out of my laptop. Love it. 
Cons:. not as good as a CRT and more expensive but getting there. 

$$;
Pros:. Thinest bezel re picture area, excellent brightness, above average contrast, easy flip between horizontal and vertical positions, and multiple USB2 sockets. 
Cons:. Blurring of small text, mentioned by editor, leads to effective loss of contrast with "some" small fonts. As of this date (11/04), there many more competitors at lower prices so my rating score may be outdated.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color is nice, menu has many options, DVI connection. 180deg viewing angle. image like best CRT, not blurry. DVD Finging Memo was a nice example of this screen capability, True 32 bit colors or close, and no gosting.. 
Cons:. None ! only on small font on a speedsheet some melting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect colors, bright picture, easy set up, versatile, wide viewing angle...and the price is excellent.. 
Cons:. Response time isn't quite fast enough to avoid being noticeable onse in a while. If you're paranoid about repsponse time, look elsewhere...but be prepared to drop a LOT of money.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this for monitor $582 including overnight shipping and no tax. For the price, it's the best deal around. Maybe I got lucky, but I can't find any dead pixels on my 1901FP. HOW TO GET THE BEST PICTURE: Initially I was very disappointed with the. 
Cons:. The only downside to this monitor is the cable management prongs on the back of the monitor. They're made from fairly thin plastic and look like they could snap off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Adjusts up or down easily and switches vertically as well! Very please with this monitor!. 

$$;
Pros:. Go on over to Dell's Small Biz web site and check out the sale price(was $540 as of 12/18/2003). I have been shopping around for an LCD for almost a year now. I wanted at least 19", and was hoping to get one that had digital and analog interface .. and I. 
Cons:. None yet. Though with all the talk about lack of resolution choices on this one, I say more is better Dell!. 

$$;
Pros:. Performance was important to me. I wanted a 17 or 19" LCD that had good numbers: contrast/brightness/response time and analog and DVI connection. I was looking at the 17" Planar and the 19" Planar. The 17" Planar had great specs with fast response time. 
Cons:. Faster response time would be nice.. 

$$;
Pros:. At first my eyes were set on ViewSonic VP191b but I could not justify the price difference when the Dell rep offered to add this monitor to the Dimension 8300 for just $500. I was very impressed with the sturdy construction and overall quality of this pr. 
Cons:. None at this time.. 

$$;
Pros:. The built in USB 2.0 Hub is priceless; The On-Screen menu is very intuitive and useful for making those minor adjustments, but to be honest the default factory settings are gorgeous as it stands so I didn't change anything; With cleartype turned on text. 
Cons:. Slight ghosting during fast video sequences, but only enough to be noticed if your looking for it (typically for a 25ms response time on the LCDs) The only reason I gave it a 5 on service and support is that Dell on the whole has become a huge pain in th. 

$$;
Pros:. sleek design very bright, saturated colors usb ports multiple inputs (DVI and VGA). 

$$;
Pros:. I picked this up to save some space and get rid of my 75lb. Dell 1110p 21" CRT. The form factor of the 1901FP is gorgeous. The best i've ever seen. You'll love the aesthetics of this one. Build quality is not flimsy and very solid. The picture color is. 
Cons:. Response time. Response time. I am a heavy gamer so this was important to me. I have tried the 17" LCD from Hitachi that boasts a 16ms response time. But that screen was more tall than wide and the picture was not clean. The 1901FP suffers from minor ghos. 

$$;
Pros:. great design features, attractive looking.. 
Cons:. i had a few issues with dell. i ordered two of these on 12/4/03 and finally received them on 1/26/04. dell gave me the run around.. they told me that the first shipment was damaged, the second shipment was stolen en route, the third shipment got cancelled. 

$$;
Pros:. Most everyone on this site paid between $450 and $600 for this monitor, sorry folks but that's not all that realistic, I just bought it last week and paid $611.10, that's with 10% off and free shipping. The regular price is $679. Still a good value but. 
Cons:. The Portrait mode software does not ship with the monitor, it is free but you must download it from Dell after you receive your monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture, nice design, built-in USB 2.0 hub, digital and analog inputs. 
Cons:. Dell support doesn't know how to spell monitor. Held for 30 minutes and figured out how to use portrait mode while on "perma-hold". 

$$;
Pros:. Everything that's good about this monitor is true--size, image quality, adjustability, and versatility.. 
Cons:. NO PIVOTING SOFTWARE, POOR SUPPORT However, WHY DOES DELL MARKET THIS AS PIVOTING/ROTATING WHEN IT DOES NOT SHIP PIVOTING SOFTWARE? I've spend almost 6 hours in 2 days calling Dell customer support and everyone asks me for an "express service code" but. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features and superb presentation. Pricey but affordable. Great Analog display capability.. 
Cons:. I cannot get the Digital input to work using a Belkin DVI cable. Maybe it is not compatible with the Belkin line.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the quality of this monitor and the way its built. I love games and most of them I don't run higher than 1280 anyway.. 
Cons:. as an IT Administrator this monitor just doesn't serve its purpose. I need a nice high res like 1680 at least!. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, nice mounting system, easy setup.. 
Cons:. color depth and calibration aren't all that great. Ordered two, and both went on back order once. The second went on backorder AGAIN. I had a friend that ordered the same monitor 3 weeks after I did and they got thiers first. I cancelled the order for the. 

$$;
Pros:. price, design. 
Cons:. Doesn't work out of the box. Good luck finding anyone at Dell's tech support that can help.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really good color, crisp image, 4 usb hub, VERY adjustable.. 
Cons:. The specs state that this is a 25 ms monitor, but I see a 4-pixel long trail whenever something darker than about 50% gray moves against something else of the same intensity. It is very distracting when scrolling through web pages or dragging around wind. 

$$;
Pros:. Please provide a link. I am only finding this for $679 everyone else appears to be getting deals in the sub $600 range. Thanks. Please email me at spyromalas@hotmail.com.
