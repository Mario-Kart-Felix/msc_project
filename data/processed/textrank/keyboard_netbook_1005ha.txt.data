, Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .
The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .
Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
