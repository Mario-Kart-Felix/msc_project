The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .
A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
If you want good food at a decent price, there is a restaurant called Houlihan's down the street from the hotel on Wacker St .
