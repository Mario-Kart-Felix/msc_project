Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .
Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
all these hotels charge parking fees .
Hotel parking   is now $23 a night .
