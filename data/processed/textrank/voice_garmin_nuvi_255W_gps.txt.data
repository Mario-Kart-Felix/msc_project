First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .
I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
The voice is clear and easy to understand .
