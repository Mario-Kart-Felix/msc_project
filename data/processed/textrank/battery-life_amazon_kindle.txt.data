After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .
Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .
Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .
