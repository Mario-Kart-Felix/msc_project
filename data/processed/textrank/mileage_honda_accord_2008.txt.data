The car drives great and gets better gas mileage than my 2000 Lincoln LS V8 .
It looks great, handles well, and gets good gas mileage .
The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .
At first the gas mileage was a disappointment, but as the car is now breaking in   it's getting better .
It's fun to drive, and gets great gas mileage .
