But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .
Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .
I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .
