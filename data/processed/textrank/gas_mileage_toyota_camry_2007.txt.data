Ride seems comfortable and gas mileage fairly good averaging 26 city and 30 open road .
Being a mother who drives a lot I wanted a safe vehicle with good gas mileage and this car delivered that and more .
Toyota may have computerized the engine and transmission to get better gas mileage but the very best I can get is 25 mpg on the highway .
