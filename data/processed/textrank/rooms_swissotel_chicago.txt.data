The Swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .
My son loved the Chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .
Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .
Large clean rooms and comfortable bed .
The rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .
