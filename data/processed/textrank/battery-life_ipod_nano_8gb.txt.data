the battery life  this was an awsome christmas present and i love it its really easy to use and sounds great .
this is my first ipod and its awsome the only thing i dont like is the battery life it lasts all day if you dont use it a lot but if you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .
