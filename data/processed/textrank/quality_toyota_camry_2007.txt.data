Mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the Toyota, hype I was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old Chevy .
Overall a good car, no build quality issues yet .
The ride, the fit and the build quality are what I was expecting after owning Toyotas in the past .
