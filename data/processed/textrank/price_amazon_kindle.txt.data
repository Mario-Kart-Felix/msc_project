since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .
I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .
