I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .
Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .
Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .
easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .
