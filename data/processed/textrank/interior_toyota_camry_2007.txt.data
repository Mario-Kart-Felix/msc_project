The interior looks good but feels cheap compared to my 1997 LE camry .
I love its Avalon like roomy interior and great looks .
Like the looks and styling, both interior and exterior .
The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .
I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .
The plastic interior looks and feels cheap .
