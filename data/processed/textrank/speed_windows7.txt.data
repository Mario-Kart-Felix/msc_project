Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .
I can finally use adobe CS4, before with Vista 32bit photoshop cs4 wouldn't run so smoothly as cs3 but now it opens faster and is just working great .
