The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .
s a great car, spacious, comfortable, fun to drive, and handles very well .
The Accord has looks, comfort, great ride and reliability .
The car is roomy inside, comfortable, handles and performs great and is fun to drive .
The driver, side seat is not comfortable .
Driver seat could be more comfortable however, but I love everything about it .
