The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .
We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .
