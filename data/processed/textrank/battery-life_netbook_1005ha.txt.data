The reason I went with Asus is the long battery life without the huge bump in the back   ,  a fast processer, easy memory upgrade, good looks and great price .
another, i needed one that had a LONG battery life, since it would be a bother to have to charge a netbook every 4, 5 hours .
For another $50, you get a 6 cell battery with 8 hours of run time .
Unboxed the netbook, put in the battery, charged it up, everything was great .
