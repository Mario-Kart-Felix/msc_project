The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor .
It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .
Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .
