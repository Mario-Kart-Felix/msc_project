I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .
This is a great GPS, it is so easy to use and it is always accurate .
I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .
