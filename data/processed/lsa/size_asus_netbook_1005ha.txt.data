 It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter . I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops . I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :  I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .
