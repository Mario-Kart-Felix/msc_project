 Also it is perfect for the Gloucester Road tube station with direct trains to Heathrow airport terminals,very good location turn right as you exit the station the hotels a 3 minute walk on your right hand side . The good thing about this hotel is its location, you are a 10 minute walk from Harrods and £13 taxi ride to Covent Garden which will take you past all the tourist attractions :  Loved the location as it's only a 1, minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube station . b basis Hotel huge ,  900 rooms Buffet breakfast good for a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again  The location is also good because it is literally 150 footsteps   from Gloucester Road Underground Station .
