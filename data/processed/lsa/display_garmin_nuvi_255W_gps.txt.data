 Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom . I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .
