 However, there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1 terrible driver seat comfort, kills my back 2 lack luster interior design, my Acadia has much better comfort 3 the VCM drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is perceptible enough to be an annoyance . The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   . my first fill up was 26 mpg mixed city and hwy I only expect it to get better, steering is tight and precise, only complaints are road noise is more than i like but its livable, rain or just dew pours in right on top of the power window controls when the window is cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car .
