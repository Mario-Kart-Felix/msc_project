 I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc . _________________________ UPDATE__________________________  With the TomTom, if you update to the newest map firmware you get everything the Garmin 765 has minus the traffic . Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .
