 I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought . Most books, however, are very easy to read, and the variable font size enables me to find the font size that works best for me .
