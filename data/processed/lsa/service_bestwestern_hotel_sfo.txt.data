 So to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague I did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them . Excellent service great location good value The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .
