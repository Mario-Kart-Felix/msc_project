 Good price through ExpediaHotel in general is in good shapeTips :  I would not stay at this Holiday Inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in London . After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !
