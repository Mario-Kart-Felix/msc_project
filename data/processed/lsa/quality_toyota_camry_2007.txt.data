 This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage   JBL radio is low quality cd, fm, and mp3 all sound the same . While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .
