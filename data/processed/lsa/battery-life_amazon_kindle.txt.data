 You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing . Kindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging, very thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1, What I'm ambivalent about ,  I don't find the battery life any better than the K1, I thought the K1 battery life was perfectly fine . The original Kindle had a removable battery and you could buy extra batteries in case you'd be away from a power source for an extended time .
