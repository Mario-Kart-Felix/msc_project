 This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage   To top things off, the car gets terrible mileage . I purchased this camry, three weeks ago, acceleration is a major problem, just not like the older models of camry, was in a accident, hit on the front right side, right fender, car was considered total loss, not fixable, I would not purchase another camry disappointed is this 2007 camry, gas mileage is not as good as prior years, i had to purchase another vehicle, it was not a camry, made in ky, it was a solid 2007 toyota RAV4 made in japan . I would highly reccomend this car If your looking for a sporty, roomy, 4 door sedan with good gas mileage  Safety was #1 and mileage was #2 .
