 4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover . This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted . I have the following software installed and they work great, modest but tolerable performance reduction :  No noticeable performance reduction  Performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .
