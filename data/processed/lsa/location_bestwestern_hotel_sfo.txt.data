 nice hotel great location liked the little extras  The location was PERFECT just a block and a half from fisherman's wharf and in walking distance to the pier with the sea lions, ghirardelli square,   and the start of the cable car tour on the hill, and also was a block and a half from the starbucks where the streetcar stops to take you to other parts of the city . A great hotel in a great location we found a friendly staff through out the hotel great location,rooms were small but as pointed out to me all land is prime in the area and all places have small rooms . Great hotel in a great location for Fisherman's Wharf Great Location ,  Hotel room good also  Overall an average hotel in a great location  The location was great as we were within walking distance to just about everything .
