 If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is . Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .
