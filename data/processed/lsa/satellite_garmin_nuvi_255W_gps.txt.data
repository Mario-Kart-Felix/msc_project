 Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable . Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .
