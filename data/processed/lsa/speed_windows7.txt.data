 , faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista ,  seriously  Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but ,  Fast startup and performance  Also, in my non, benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster . It made my system faster which i didn't think was possible, it has a more creative appeal, i didn't lose any of my important files and the installation went smoothly and without any kinks whatsoever Windows 7 is fun, fast and creative, , it finally gave a newer more interesting look to the paint program and i have no issues at all  My notebook runs so much faster .
