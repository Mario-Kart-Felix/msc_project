 Cheapened interior materials, flimsy steering wheel switch gear, less padding in seats, only a 2, way power passenger seat, plastic covered board for seat, back map pockets, baby, puke yellow fake wood trim, etc . Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily . My only complaint with the interior is the color of the fake wood :  The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .
