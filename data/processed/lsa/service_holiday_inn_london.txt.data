 I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro . Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !
