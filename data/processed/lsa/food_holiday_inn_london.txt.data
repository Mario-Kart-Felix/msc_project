 As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap : The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby . Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do ! The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
