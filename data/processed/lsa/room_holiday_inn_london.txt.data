 2,  When I tried to check in 2 days later they simply gave me a single bed room where my reservation was a twin bed room when they corrected it   I went to my room it was a smoking room   I had to go back to change it they said there is no rooms available   I have to sleep the night   they will transfer me in the next day like it was my fault  !
