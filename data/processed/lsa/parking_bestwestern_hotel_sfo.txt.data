 Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :  I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true . Note to those with a car, overnight valet parking is $26 but right next door the car park is $15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel ,  why pay $26 ?
