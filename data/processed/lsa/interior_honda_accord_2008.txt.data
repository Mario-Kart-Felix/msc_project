 The car has a 268 hp engine which provides plenty of power for passing and yet the car gets 31 to 33 mpg the interior of the car is well laid out and the controls and gauges are easy to read and handle the fit and finish of the car is flawless a well built car the exterior design is smooth and flowing well done without excessive curves and as usual the Honda reliability remains its strong point I love driving this car I hate to get out of it at days end this is the first Honda I've purchased ill never drive anything other than a Honda again  Excellent pickup and great interior . I previously owned a Chrysler 300 2006, so it is difficult going from a real comfortable interior, really massive dash to a bland and old fashioned interior . Eye,  catching appeal  fit and finish exterior interior  safety features laudable  audio system good esp w XM radio  interior room spacious  3 .
