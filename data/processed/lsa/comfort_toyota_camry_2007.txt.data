 This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage  We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car . Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   . The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .
