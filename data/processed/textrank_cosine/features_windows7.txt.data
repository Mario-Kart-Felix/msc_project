 But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers . LEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me :  They're features I don't use . ,  New features with better window and file managment ,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X  Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too .
