 Free Wifi in your room, and the free wine reception in the evenings was great . The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day . Morning coffee and biscotti was a nice touch as well as the all you can drink free wine hour in the evening .
