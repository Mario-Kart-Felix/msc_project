 A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food . My only complaint is the Palm restaurant, it is expensive and the food not very good . The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .
