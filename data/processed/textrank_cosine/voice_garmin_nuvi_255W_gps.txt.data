 I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn . A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads . The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
